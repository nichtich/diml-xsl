Since DocBook and DiML both use the CALS table model we can reuse
the XSL DocBook Stylesheet. The files still need some cleanup,
handling of element 'caption' and 'legend' ...

The main differences between tables in DocBook and DiML

- no mixed content 'entry' elements in DiML
- element 'table' in DocBook:
   table ::= ((blockinfo?,
              (title,titleabbrev?), (indexterm)*, textobject*,
              (graphic+|mediaobject+|tgroup+)))
- element 'table' in DiML:
    table ::= (caption ? , legend * , tgroup + , legend *)
  [there will also be a way to use media objects in tables]
