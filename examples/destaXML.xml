         			Introduction
      </head>
			<p>Ethiopia has an estimated 29.5 million cattle distributed within the different agroecological zones (Sendros and Tesfaye,
         1997). The arid, semi-arid and sub-humid zones are homes for 14% of the cattle population each while 6% and 52% of the cattle
         population inhabit the humid zones and the highlands of the country, respectively. The majority of the cattle population is
         found in the highlands of Ethiopia where 43.6% of the human agricultural population is residing which indicates that cattle
         has a very important role in the Ethiopian economy (Jahnke, 1982). A total of 800,000 tones of milk and 220,000 tones of meat are produced by cattle annually which account for 30% the agricultural products that contribute
         46% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Livestock also has a significant share from the export earnings (15%) (Azage and
         Alemu, 1997). In addition, 14 million tones of manure are used annually primarily for heating and six million oxen provide the draught power required for the cultivation of grain crops (Azage and Alemu, 1998 and Brannang
         and Persson, 1990).
      </p>
			<p>Although the livestock sector has a significant contribution to the national economy, animal productivity is extremely low.
         This is evidenced by the very low per capita consumption of protein and a very low growth rate of milk and meat production
         that is below the recommended average rate needed to feed the growing population (Sendros and Tesfaye, 1997). With an annual
         growth rate of 3.5% the human population in Ethiopia will increase to about 139 million by the year 2020, therefore, the demand
         for animal products is estimated to increase substantially (Azage and Alemu, 1997). The low productivity is due to a number
         of factors among which are quantitative and qualitative deficiencies in the feed resource base, diseases, poor animal performance
         level and insufficient knowledge on the dynamics of the different types of farming systems existing in the country (Plaizier,
         1993).
      </p>
			<p>Among all factors emphasis has been given for the improvement of the genetic potential of the local breeds of cattle in the
         country. Over 99% of the cattle population in Ethiopia are indigenous and about 42% are milk cows (Tsehay,1997 and Azage and
         Alemu,1997). There are over six distinguishable, indigenous cattle types in Ethiopia evolved mainly as a results of natural
         selection influenced by factors like climate, altitude, available feed supply, endemic diseases, functional objectives of
         livestock owners, management 
         
         <pagenumber edition="2"/>techniques and market demands that make them adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Most of them belong to the Zebu-type
         with the inclusion of some intermediate short horn Sanga type (Albero and Solomon, 1982 and Ethiopian Mapping Agency, 1981).
         Almost all indigenous cattle are in the hands of the small holder subsistence farmers that represent 85% of the human population
         (MOA, 1993). The average milk production capacity of the indigenous cow per head per lactation is estimated at 213 kg which
         is very low (Azage and Alemu,1997). The introduction of exotic (temperate) breeds has been suggested as one option to improve
         the productivity of indigenous cattle, but it has become expensive and risky because the exotic breeds are susceptible to
         diseases and the cost of milk production is often greater than the gross income that can be obtained. Therefore, combining
         the adaptability (hardiness, disease tolerance, ability to walk long distance in search of feed and water and heat tolerance)
         of native cattle with the high milk production potential and faster growth rates of temperate cattle through cross breeding,
         especially for dairy production, has been practiced as a more sustainable way to improve productivity. This has opened the
         door for market oriented dairy production systems with improved genotypes and better management that, however, today represent
         only 0.3% of the total cattle population (Tsehay,1997). Moreover, urbanization (29.2% of the total population will live in
         growing urban areas by 2020) and the subsequent decrease in the number of rural community will create a substantial increase
         in the urban demand for animal products particularly for milk (Azage and Alemu,1997). Dairy production systems which can respond
         to such a demand under conditions of unfavorable infrastructure are found in the peri-urban and urban areas. 
      </p>
			<p>
         			Breed improvement programs for dairy production in Ethiopia were started by importing pure temperate breed of cows during
         the Italian occupation and since then crossbreeding using temperate breeds and indigenous breeds has been practiced by a number
         of governmental and non-governmental institutions. However, these efforts have been met with little success because of the
         various technical, organizational and socioeconomic constraints. There has been no concrete and binding breeding policy with
         regard to the choice of the exotic breed types to be crossed with the indigenous animals and the corresponding exotic blood
         level of the crosses (Tesfaye, 1990). In addition, most of the breeding programs had no clearly defined breeding objectives
         and in almost all of the production systems performance recording has been difficult. 
         			Alemu et al. 
         			(1993) indicated that performance recording procedures in some eastern and southern African countries has 
         			
         
					<pagenumber edition="3"/>
				
         			been insufficient and unstandardized. They have further stressed that such schemes have not focused their activities on the
         smallholder producers who are increasingly dominating the dairy industry in the region. Breeding value estimation and selection
         for improved productivity would be difficult, therefore, without well defined breeding objectives and reliable performance
         recording system. With respect to distribution of selected breeding animals AI has been playing a significant role in Ethiopia.
         However, its activities have been unsatisfactory and limited to the Capital and some major cities due to a number of technical,
         financial, infrastructural and managerial constraints that prevail in the developing counties (Azage, 1995). On the other
         hand bull service for dairy breed improvement is being practiced as an option to a limited extent by some governmental and
         non-governmental institutions like the SDDP in the rural Ethiopia, however, the sustainability of this option is in question
         due to the uncertainty of the economic status of farmers to replace bulls (Bittner et al., 2000). 
         		
      </p>
			<p>Furthermore, improvement of the already existing indigenous genotypes or their replacement with superior types depends on
         the knowledge of the attributes of these genotypes and the socio-economic factors that affect production in those environments
         (Trail, 1984). The conventional methods lack awareness on the traditional management systems operating within the existing
         constraints. Therefore, gathering of additional information pertaining the current breeding and cattle management practices
         from farmers and opinion leaders in a participatory process for the development of a national or regional breeding programs
         has become a prerequisite to formulate appropriate and acceptable breeding programs for the improvement of cattle productivity.
         In addition, reviewing the current role of modern breeding tools and technologies and level of application in the country
         is essential (Sendros and Tesfaye, 1997). 
      </p>
			<p>Natural mating as a means to propagate improved genotypes has to be tested against the risk of venereal diseases some of which
         are zoonotic. In general, venereal diseases affect fertility by altering the reproductive environment, so that there may be
         impaired sperm transport, sperm death or embryonic and fetal deaths. There are several sexually transmitted bacterial, protozoal.,
         viral and mycoplasmal infections. Brucellosis is one of these diseases with a significant negative effect on fertility. The
         fact that this disease could be transmitted through natural service and AI makes it more important than other infectious causes
         of infertility. 
      </p>
			<p>
				
					<pagenumber edition="4"/>
				A number of investigations done on Brucellosis in Ethiopia indicate that it is more prevalent in improved breeds of cattle,
         that are believed to be the best options to improve the dairy productivity in the country. The prevalence in improved breeds
         varies from 7.62% to 38.7 % while in locals it varies from 3% to 4.2 % (Abebe, 1989, Bayleyegn, 1989, Endrias, 1989, Muktar, 1993 and Tekelye et al, 1989). Tariku (1994) estimated that the annual economic loss due to Brucellosis, that arises
         from abortion, extended calving interval and increased culling rate, in Cheffa State Farm in Ethiopia, amounts to Birr 88,
         941.96 (approximately 11,000 EUR).

   Status and prospect of the dairy industry </head>
				<subsection>
					<head>
      
   Status of the dairy industry</head>
					<p>In the western world, the dairy industry is dominated by family farms. However, a strong trend towards larger farms has emerged
         in recent years that result in a drastic reduction in the number of farms. In Eastern Europe countries, that are in a process
         of transition, the large collective dairy farms have been privatized and often have been split up into smaller farms. The
         process of transition is, however, accompanied by great uncertainties due to the unclear and uncertain economic and political
         situation and also to the inappropriate dairy policy. In the developing countries, there are milk producers that practice
         traditional and non-traditional dairy productions. In areas that practice the non-traditional dairy production, the structure
         of dairying is more varied. Besides small farms there are also large scale specialized dairy farms. In the traditional milk
         producing regions, specially those of Africa, the structure of milk production is characterized by small farms with not more
         than three or four animals. Dairying is nearly always part of a mixed farming system. Livestock are fed principally on agricultural
         residues and are grazed on natural pastures of non-arable land. Cattle husbandry and milk production is largely supported
         by the by-products of agriculture (Schelhaas, 1999). The dairy cows produce food to the family, provide direct cash income,
         are capital assets, produce manure for use as fertilizers and fuel and may be source of power for transport and cultivation.
         The highlands of Sub-Saharan Africa are the most productive in terms of milk per ha in the traditional dairy production system,
         but production per head of cattle is lower than in the dry zone (70 Vs 58 kg); this is because the majority of cattle are
         found in the Ethiopian highlands, where male stock used for traction comprise a high fraction of the herd (de Leeuw et al,
         1999).
      </p>

   Prospects of the dairy industry</head>
					<p>Delgado et al. (2001) forecasted that there will be globally an increment in demand for milk and milk products, in the next
         two decades, fueled by population growth, urbanization and income growth (de Leeuw et al., 1999). The strongest growth in
         demand for milk and milk products is anticipated to come from developing countries, where it is projected to grow at the rate
         of 3 percent annually (Griffin, 1999). Africa south of the Sahara is 
         
							<pagenumber edition="7"/>
						expected to register 3.3 % increase in demand for milk and milk products in 2020 (Delgado et al., 2001). In addition, world
         production of milk is also forecasted to grow by an annual rate of slightly over one percent and the largest increment is
         expected in developing countries (Griffin, 1999). Delgado et al. (2001) projected the annual growth rate of milk production
         in developing countries between 1997-2020 to be 2.73% and a 4% annual growth in milk production was projected between 1993 and 2020 in Sub-Saharan Africa (Delgado et al., 1999). 
      </p>
					<p>In addition, internationalization and privatization are also among the forces that are acting towards change. A number of
         agreements have been signed that would represent a major breakthrough on the road towards a free world dairy market. These
         agreements have been aimed at a reduction of the level of domestic market protection and a lowering of export subsidies by
         the developed world and hence to an enlargement of the scope for imports (Schelhaas, 1999). 
      </p>
					<p>Nevertheless, a number of factors will continue to limit the development of the dairy industry in the Sub-Saharan Africa.
         Higher levels of production than those achieved in traditional tropical systems often require the improvement of the productivity of dairy breeds, improved feed base, adoption of new technologies and equipment to improve production
         efficiency and improving levels of inputs and infrastructure; both for milk sales and input acquisition (Egan, 1999 and De
         Boer, 1999). It could be difficult for many countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa to satisfactorily meet these requirements
         due to their poor financial and technical capabilities.

   Dairy production systems in Ethiopia</head>
				<p>Four major systems of dairy production can be distinguished in Ethiopia. These are: lowland pastoral dairy production systems,
         rural highland small-holder dairy production system, urban and peri-urban small scale dairy production system and large scale
         dairy production system. 
      </p>
				<subsection>
					<head>
      
   Lowland pastoralist dairy farming</head>
					<p>About 30% of the livestock population in Ethiopia are found in the pastoral areas. These areas comprise 50% of the total land
         area of the country and have altitudes below 1500m.a.s.l. Pastoralism is the major dairy production system in the lowland.
         Livestock 
         
							<pagenumber edition="8"/>
						doesn't provide inputs for crop production but are the very backbone of their owners providing all of the consumable and saleable
         out puts and regarded as insurance against adversity. Milk production is dependent on season due to the rainfall pattern that
         influences feed availability (Ketema and Tsehay, 1995). 
      </p>
				</subsection>
				<subsection>
					<head>
      
   Rural highland small-holder dairy farming</head>
					<p>There are two types of systems in the highland. The traditional system that is based on indigenous breeds and the market oriented
         system that is based on crossbred dairy cattle. The average lactation yield for indigenous cows is 524 liters for 239 days
         and the average age at first calving is 53 months and the average calving interval is 25 months. Tesfaye (1995) reported that
         the average milk yield and lactation length for crossbred dairy cows ranges from 518.8-1448 kg and 110-300 days, respectively,
         depending on the breed type. The milk produced is mainly consumed by the household in the traditional system while most of
         the milk is sold to generate income in the market oriented system. 
      </p>
				</subsection>
				<subsection>
					<head>
      
   Urban and peri-urban small scale dairy farming</head>
					<p>This system is developed in and around major cities and towns located mainly in the highlands of Ethiopia. The main feed resources
         are agro-industrial byproducts and purchased roughage. The system comprises small and medium sized dairy farms that own crossbreed
         dairy cows. Farmers use all or part of their land for forage production. The primary objective of milk production is generating additional
         cash income to the household (Ketema and Tsehay, (1995) and Azage et al., (2000)).
      </p>
				</subsection>
				<subsection>
					<head>
      
   Large scale dairy farming</head>
					<p>This system is a specialized market oriented dairy operation practiced by the state sector and very few private commercial
         farms. Most of these farms are located in and around Addis Ababa and basically keep exotic dairy stock (Ketema and Tsehay,
         (1995) and Azage et al., (2000)).
      </p>
				</subsection>
			</section>
			<section>
				<head>
      
   The role of the dairy sector in the Ethiopian economy</head>
				<p>At household level dairying is important in one way or another in all the farming systems of Ethiopia. In pastoralist farming
         system and the crop farming areas milk is the most important source of protein (Tilahun, 1995). In the mixed farming systems
         milk is also 
         
						<pagenumber edition="9"/>
					used mainly as food to the household and to a lesser extent as a source of income (FAO,1999). In the urban and peri-urban
         areas dairy production is practiced mainly as a source of income.
      </p>
				<p>At macro-level, there is scarcity of information that estimate the share of the dairy sector in the GDP. However, the report
         of Azage and Alemu (1997) indicted that 800, 000 metric tones of milk are produced every year. The very low per capita consumption
         of milk (20 kg per annum) is lower than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa, and this indicates that the actual level of dairy
         productivity is extremely low.
      </p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<head>
      
   The prospects of dairy farming in Ethiopia</head>
				<p>An increase in total human population and accelerated rate of urbanization characterize the Ethiopian society in the coming 25
         years. The urban community with high purchasing power represent the main milk market. There will be, therefore, an increase
         in demand for milk and milk products in the future in urban areas and, hence, large commercial and market oriented small-holder
         peri-urban dairy production systems have tremendous potential for development.
      </p>

   Constraints of Dairy Production in Ethiopia</head>
				<subsection>
					<head>
      
   Increasing human population and the composition of livestock population</head>
					<p>The human population in Ethiopia, currently estimated at 60 million is growing by about 3.5% per annum with an estimated population
         of about 139 million by the year 2020 (Azage and Alemu, 1997). This high population growth will force people to cultivate
         more land at the cost of grazing land and requires more traction power and as a result the herd in particular and the livestock
         population at large will be composed more of traction animals that create pressure on the grazing land (Ketema and Tsehay,
         1995).

   Policy and socioeconomic issues</head>
					<p>
         			Land ownership and land rights
         			: the 1975 land reform legislation abolished all forms of private ownership of land and put land under state control (Desalegn,
         1984) and land ownership remains still in the hands of the state (Girma and Zegeye, 1996 and USDC, 1999). The issue of land
         ownership with respect to dairy production is particularly important in the urban and peri-urban areas. The land policy doesn't
         make individuals, who 
         			
         
							<pagenumber edition="10"/>
						
         			already have land, free and secure to invest more on the land and there is also scarcity and difficulty in acquiring new land.
         Land for investment purposes could be obtained by lease, with prices set by periodic auctions, which is beyond the capability
         of most of the small scale and medium scale dairy farmers. 
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Farmers' participation
         			: farmers have in general limited opportunity and authority to participate in decision making processes for what is economically,
         socially and culturally good for them. Most obviously, government intervention is based on a top-down development approach
         which has lead to the imposition of ideas (Tesfaye, 1990).
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Dairy policy
         			: three general periods of changing dairy policy can be identified in Ethiopia. The first era under the imperial regime favored
         the large indigenous commercial farmers in peri-urban areas which were assisted by subsidized milk collection, assured land
         tenure and free markets for feed and other issues. However, the small-holder dairy producers had no means to get improved
         dairy cows and thus their development was suppressed. The period under the socialist regime was characterized by nominal but
         not actual support for small-holders. The actual support was for unprofitable large scale state farm productions. The policies
         during this time increased the uncertainties of land tenure, feed supply restrictions and reduced formal producer prices.
         In the present period, the government starts to liberalize dairy policies but the changes are gradual. Private producers can
         participate at a greater degree and there are no feed supply restrictions (Staal and Shapiro, 1996). 
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Dairy import policy
         			: dairy imports have implications on food availability, overall imports and the development of domestic milk production. Import
         policies regarding dairy products in most African countries are usually targeted at generating revenue for the national budget,
         to provide consumers with dairy products at reasonable prices, to stimulate domestic dairy developments and move towards self-sufficiency
         and to control the balance of foreign exchange. The problem is that governments pursue several objectives simultaneously that
         may be contradictory and unbalanced (von Massow, 1989). In Ethiopia, importation of dairy products to partially fulfill local
         demand of the formal market dominated the dairy sector in the last two decades. According to the 1994 report of DDE, imported
         dairy products have a substantial market share in Addis Ababa (Belachew, 1997) and have impact on the price of milk from local
         producers. 
         		
      </p>
					<p>
						
							<pagenumber edition="11"/>
						
         			Marketing system and price policy
         			: Staal et al. (1998) indicated that most milk and dairy marketing (88%) occurs through the informal sector and Belachew (1997)
         had reported the same. The informal marketing system involves direct delivery of fresh milk by producers to consumers in the
         immediate neighborhood and sales to itinerate traders or individuals in nearby towns. The informal market is scarce especially
         for the smallholder farmers during the fasting season of the Ethiopian Orthodox Christians when people do not eat animal products
         (R&uuml;ther et al., 1998). The formal milk marketing system were dominated by Dairy Development Enterprise (DDE), which functions
         as milk producer, collector and processor. However, following the liberalization of the dairy policy, with which the government
         intervention in the marketing and pricing of livestock products is minimized, private institutions also have started taking
         part in milk collection and processing business.
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Credit facilities and incentives
         			: credit is a very important tool in dairy development by providing farmers with a capacity to invest in order to increase
         productivity of the dairy operations. Available credits from the Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank in Ethiopia
         are targeted to the crop sector mainly for purchases of oxen, fertilizers and improved seed. According to the 1990-94 Rural
         Credit Performance Reports of AIDB, the livestock sectors share was only 3% of the total credit services given to the rural
         community (Bekele, 1995). In Ethiopia, incentives given to dairy producers to enhance their development is not broad based
         and is limited to a very small proportion of the total number of dairy farmers.
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Environmental issues
         			: environmental issues associated with the pastoral and highland small-holder dairy production systems are overgrazing and
         land degradation that are the results of continuous utilization of crop lands and communal grazing lands without rehabilitation
         and conservation works. Hygienic and sanitary hazard and pollution of soil, water and air due to a large volume of waste and
         close human-animal interaction are environmental risks associated with the urban, peri-urban and the intensive commercial
         dairy production systems (FAO, 1999). 
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Quality control and public health issues
         			: there are no official rules and regulations to control the quality of milk produced and distributed to consumers. At the
         DDE milk quality control and pasteurization is practiced routinely for milk entering the processing plant, which is a very
         small proportion of the total amount of milk produced in the country 
         			
         
							<pagenumber edition="12"/>
						
         			(13%) (R&uuml;ther et al., 1998). Yilkal (1998) reported that the highest proportion of milk (71%) is distributed to consumers
         informally as raw milk without passing through any type of quality and safety tests. However, this problem is expected to
         reduce with currently flourishing private business institutions doing pasteurization and processing of milk.
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Infrastructure
         			: partial or complete lack of properly constructed all weather roads in the country affects rural dairy farming in that farmers
         are not able to deliver dairy products to the open market and buy dairy inputs easily. Furthermore, most of the animal feeds
         are byproducts of human food production plants with an unreliable availability. The small number of state owned and private
         animal feed production plants do not fulfill the demand of the growing dairy farming sector. The veterinary service coverage
         in Ethiopia is 77034 VLU (Veterinary Livestock Unit) per veterinarian and 37904 VLU per assistant veterinarian (Daborn et
         al, 1998 and ILCA, 1993). The VLU per veterinarian is below the recommended value where as the VLU per assistant veterinarians,
         that work very close to or within the rural community, is more than three times the recommended value. Even if the VLU value
         per veterinarian is below the recommended, a recent study in some part of Ethiopia indicated that more than 43% of them are
         stationed in the regional capitals and the roads to the rural area are poorly developed (Catley, 1999).

   Institutional constraints</head>
					<p>
         			Research and information exchange systems
         			: considering the importance of a central institution to guide and coordinate agricultural researches and an organized information
         system to publicize results of research works, new technologies and policy (Goshu, 1995), EARO (Ethiopian Agricultural Research
         Organization) has been established in 1997. 
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Lack of education, extension and consultation
         			: there is shortage of qualified personnel, poor education and management expertise of farmers, misunderstanding of production
         systems, lack of extension works to transfer new technologies and knowledge gained through researches to farmers, ignorance
         of the experience and knowledge of local farmers and absence of forums for consultations and discussions with farmers (Sendros
         and Tesfaye, 1997).

      </head>
					<p>
         			Health
         			: a number of parasitic, bacterial, fungal and viral diseases and nutritional deficiencies which are prevalent in the country
         affect the productivity and reproductive efficiency of dairy cattle and make individuals insecure to be involved in and invest
         on dairy production specially using cows with exotic blood. Among these diseases, venereal diseases have a direct effect while
         and nutritional deficiencies and other infectious diseases play an indirect role in hampering the reproductive efficiency
         of dairy cows. Moreover, extensive areas in the humid zone are Tse-tse infested and hence are unfavorable for livestock production
         (Teferra, 1993).
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Feed resource availability
         			: natural grazing is the most important source of feed in both the highland small-holder and pastoral dairy farming. It is
         estimated that over 90% of the total animal feed is obtained from unimproved and communal pasture, rangeland and fallow. In
         the highlands grazing resources have deteriorated as a result of human population pressure and the intensity of cultivation
         while in the lowlands livestock are restricted to areas close to permanent water sources during the dry season. Crop residues
         and byproducts of agricultural processing account for the remaining 7 and 3 percent, respectively (Tilahun, 1995). The urban
         and peri-urban dairy production systems depend more on industrial byproduct feeds whose availability is not dependable since
         the production level is far below the demand.
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Animal genetic resources
         			: according to Tsehay (1997), about 99% of the cattle population in Ethiopia are indigenous that are adapted to feed and water
         shortages, disease challenges and harsh climates. The productivity of indigenous livestock is, however, believed to be poor
         even if no practical recording scheme has been used to judge their merit. Crossbreeding has been practiced with encouraging
         results, however, a strictly controlled breeding program has not been practiced (Tesfaye, 1990) and there has been no dairy
         herd recording scheme (Alemu et al., 1993).

   Past dairy research activities</head>
				<p>Dairy research has been carried out in Ethiopia as part of agricultural research activities and dates back to the late 1940's and early 1950's with the establishment of some of the
         agricultural teaching institutions. Since 1966 IAR (the Institute of Agricultural Researches) 
         
						<pagenumber edition="14"/>
					has become the leading agricultural research institute in the country. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), the
         National Veterinary Institute (NVI), the National Tse-tse and Trypanosomiasis Investigation Center (NTTIC), Awassa College
         of Agriculture, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (FVM) at Debre Zeit and the Institute of Development Studies are directly
         or indirectly involved in livestock research (Goshu, 1995). 
      </p>
				<p>In 1997, the Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization (EARO) has been established with the proclamation number of 79/1997
         of the Federal Negarit Gazetta of the Federal Government of Ethiopia. EARO is the highest autonomous government body and the
         largest specialized agency to co-ordinate agricultural research activities in the country. EARO is primarily responsible for
         generating, improving and adapting technologies, coordinating, encouraging and assisting research activities and popularize
         agricultural research results (Frehiwot, 1997).

   Dairy cattle breeding methods</head>
				<p>The present livestock breeds in the world are the results of both natural selection and human intervention. Natural selection
         operates to provide reproductive ability and continuity of the fittest while human intervention is to change one or more traits
         of animals that the owner thinks desirable under his environment. The genetic variations available both within breeds and
         between breeds, has been used to accommodate interests and farmers wishes to make livestock more efficient in using available
         resources to produce human food and other agricultural products (Sendros and Tesfaye, 1997 and Rendel, 1991). The following
         are the commonly used dairy cattle breeding methods:
      </p>
				<p>
         			Selection within breeds: 
         			pure breeding
         		
      </p>
				<p>The goal is to build additive genetic gains into the population by identifying individual superior genotypes and preferentially
         multiplying them in the next generation (Payne and Hodges, 1997). This is the method of greatest use with cattle in the West
         and there are also reports of successful implementation of local breed improvements through selection in the tropics like
         the case of Sahiwal breed in India (Trail and Gregory, 1988). Since traits like milk yield and fertility are poorly inherited selection
         should include some form of progeny test and pedigree information (Payne and Wilson, 1999). However, more elaborate schemes
         for sire-progeny testing requiring a large active breeding population with milk recording and AI are not compatible with the level of communication, infrastructure and 
         
						<pagenumber edition="15"/>
					production intensity in most warm climate dairy systems and hence simpler schemes have to be developed for evaluating local
         genetic resource (Peters, 1991). 
      </p>
				<p>
         			Crossbreeding: 
         			mating parents of two or more different breeds together
         		
      </p>
				<p>
         			The basic objectives of crossbreeding of high performing cattle breeds with tropical breeds is to produce crossbreds with
         an expected additive genetic merit being the mean of both parental breeds. The non-additive effect which is observed as heterosis
         or hybrid vigor is the amount by which merit in crossbreds deviate from the additive component (Kinghorn, 2000) and is fully
         exploited only when non-related breeds are crossed. Payne and Hodges (1997) indicated that hybrid vigor becomes greater when
         the differences in the parental genetic make-up is high and Barlow (1981) suggested the possibility of greater hybrid vigor
         in more stressful environments. The use of temperate dairy breeds for crossbreeding with indigenous breeds has been widely
         accepted and aims at combining the superior performance of specialized dairy breeds with the superior adaptability of the
         local stock (Peters, 1991). According to Cunningham (1991) the crosses between the temperate dairy cattle breeds and local
         cattle in the tropics combined the milk producing ability of the temperate breeds with the climatic adaptability of the tropical
         breeds (Cunningham, 1991). However, the delicate balance between genetic performance ability and adaptability is determined
         by the degree of exotic inheritance (Peters, 1991). Many reports on the performance of crossbred cattle indicated that crossbreeding
         results in performance improvement only until 50% inheritance of Bos taurus genes. Cunningham and Syrstad (1988) analyzed
         46 data sets from different tropical countries and concluded that there was a nearly linear improvement of milk yield, age
         at first calving and calving interval up to 50% Bos taurus inheritance and F
         			2
         			 was inferior to F
         			1 
         			in all the traits studied. Syrstad (1985) and Vaccaro (1990) have also concluded that further upgrading more than 50% Bos
         taurus inheritance has negative effects on age at first calving, calving interval, survivability and herd life. Furthermore,
         Madalena (1993) reported that performance declined in back crosses as the Holstein-Friesian gene fraction departed higher
         or lower than 50%. Cunningham (1991) indicated that the possible explanation for the low productivity of F
         			2
         			 is the idea that blocks of genes giving favorable epistatic effects in the parental breeds and the F
         			1
         			 may be broken up in the F
         			2 
         			and subsequent generations.

         			Dairy cattle breed improvement strategy
      </head>
				<p>To achieve a meaningful development in livestock productivity through genetic improvement, sustainable and effective animal
         genetic improvement programs need to be planned, implemented and maintained. The following are some important considerations
         in designing such program.
      </p>
				<subsection>
					<head>
      
   Breeding goal definition </head>
					<p>It is the first step to be made in designing genetic improvement strategies. The breeding goal identifies those traits that
         farmers would like to improve. To be able to identify the traits, the existing and future development objective of the agricultural
         production in the country is to be defined and the livestock production system to be characterized. The current livestock
         population structure should be described and opportunities, to better utilize it and hence, maximize the realization of genetic
         gain, should be sought for and some appropriate changes should be made (Hammond and Galal, 2000). Payne and Hodges (1997)
         stated that breeding goals should match the expectations and values of the community. Furthermore, each trait in the breeding
         goal is given a 'goal value', indicating the contribution of the improvement of the trait to the realization of the development
         objectives. Since the relative rate of improvement will be faster for traits which have higher heritabilities, emphases should
         be given to traits with acceptable heritability. As a general guideline, traits with heritabilities less than 10% are considered
         lowly heritable and one can not realistically expect to make much genetic progress (Funk, 1992 ).
      </p>
				</subsection>
				<subsection>
					<head>
      
   Breeding value prediction</head>
					<p>Identification of those cattle with the highest breeding value for traits in breeding goal, is the second step that require
         performance and pedigree recording system. Estimation of breeding value needs to be based on trait measurement, either on
         the animal or on animals genetically related to the individual (van der Werf, 1999). Estimation of breeding value based on
         an animal's phenotype alone can be quiet accurate for high heritable traits like milk quality traits. A progeny test is usually
         the most accurate assessment of breeding value based on the performance of the offspring of the animal and it requires sufficient
         number of progeny to be tested (Payne and Wilson, 1999 and van der Werf, 1999). Payne and Wilson (1999) stated that progeny
         test is usually applied for bulls and is particularly 
         
							<pagenumber edition="17"/>
						valuable method where the heritability of the trait is low like milk yield and where the increase in generation interval,
         implicit in the methodology, is not too pronounced. Syrstad (1998) indicated that the rate of gain from progeny testing programs suffers from the fact
         that it takes so long for the bulls daughter to be recorded. Furthermore, Peters (1991) stated that sire-progeny testing requiring
         a large active breeding population with milk recording and AI are not compatible with the existing conditions in tropical
         dairy systems. Another alternative basis for breeding value estimation is pedigree information that takes into account the
         performance of ancestors. This method can be of value only if the pedigree information is complete (Payne and Wilson, 1999).
         Syrstad (1998) reported that selection of bulls based on pedigree information only gave the fastest genetic improvement. He
         further elaborated that many practical factors favor breeding schemes with lower generation intervals like pedigree selection
         over progeny testing. 
      </p>
				</subsection>
				<subsection>
					<head>
      
   Organization of a breeding strategy </head>
					<p>
         			It
         			 
         			is the third step and involves the designing of a well organized breeding strategy for the use of cattle with predicted breeding
         value and the dissemination of superior genes through the population (Groen, 2000). At this step is decided which animals
         to use as parents and in what combination (Kinghorn, 1999). 
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Simple field performance testing and an open nucleus breeding schemes operated through breeders associations or group breeding
         schemes has been indicated by Peters (1991) as an option to improve the productivity of indigenous breeds while Payne and
         Hodges (1997) recommended the same breeding scheme with recording and selection to take place in a local cattle station.
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			For crossbreeding, the establishment of an open nucleus breeding herd of indigenous cows by genetic screening of the local
         cow population and crossbreeding them with temperate sires to produce F
         			1
         			 bulls either to distribute the bulls to local cattle owners for natural service in the field population or to use their semen
         for AI in areas where AI is available and working successfully has been proposed by Payne and Hodges (1997). Another option
         proposed by Madalena (1993) advocates the continuous production of and supply of replacement F
         			1
         			 heifers, that are produced by dairy farmers specializing in proving replacement heifers, to dairy farmers. In addition, Payne
         and Hodges (1997) indicated that a breeding strategy in the tropics should also consider the alternative uses of another 
         			
         
							<pagenumber edition="18"/>
						
         			breeds indigenous to the tropics and purebred selection within the local indigenous cattle in cases where the use of temperate
         gene is not appropriate. Payne and Hodges (1997) and Horst (1998) further stressed the importance of introducing a package
         approach in which any genetic improvement program is accompanied by improved management, animal health, marketing options
         for the products and extension support with trained local people. 
         		
      </p>
					<p>With respect to dissemination of selected genes it is important to determine simple and efficient methods of gene transfer
         in the existing socio-economic conditions and production system (Kinghorn, 1999 and Payne and Hodges, 1997). Payne and Hodges (1997) stressed that in the vast majority of settings in the tropics with
         small scale owners, AI has failed and should not be included as part of a cattle breeding strategy and they recommended the
         use of natural mating using breeding sires. However, in areas where AI could be properly organized, it is advantageous to
         use AI since it allows the maximum exploitation of the best sires and a reduction in the total number of sires that have to
         be maintained (Payne and Wilson, 1999).

   Dairy cattle breed improvement activities in Ethiopia</head>
				<p>
         			Dairy cattle breed improvement program, in Ethiopia, was launched during the occupation of Ethiopia by Italy with importation
         of exotic dairy cattle. Later on, the First Livestock Development Project (1958-63) created the Dairy Development Agency (DDA)
         that was concerned mainly with the development of commercial dairy farms in Addis Ababa (Fekadu, 1990). Crossbreeding has
         been started by the Institute of Agricultural Research, through the establishment of an on-station Dairy Cattle Crossbreeding
         Program, using Friesian, Jersey and Simmental sires that were crossed with the local Horro, Boran and Barka dams with the
         aim of testing the productivity of crossbred dairy cows with different levels of exotic blood (EARO 1, 2001). The Chilalo
         Agricultural Development Project (CADU), an integrated project established jointly by the Ethiopian and Swedish Governments, in Arsi region initiated intensive small scale dairy development in Ethiopia in 1967/68 (Kiwuwa et al, 1983).
         This was followed by the Wolayta Agricultural Development Project (WADU) that was established in 1971 and funded by the World
         Bank, basically applied the CADU program (Haile Mariam, 1994). The livestock breed improvement program under MOA, that was
         an integral part of the National Livestock Development Projects, has also contributed to the establishment of dairy cattle

         			improvement ranches in different parts of the country. The focus of the program was on increasing the milk productivity of
         local breeds through crossbreeding and distribution of F
         			1
         			 heifers to farmers (EARO 1 , 2001). In 1987 a FINNIDA funded project of the MOA started to improve dairy cattle productivity
         at the highlands of Ethiopia through the establishment of the Selale Peasant Dairy Development Pilot Project. SPDDPP introduced
         crossbred dairy cattle and improved management skills with the objective to increase the living standard of small-holder farmers. Since 1995, the Small-holder Dairy Development Project, SDDP, that can be considered
         as the continuation of the pilot project with the same objectives but broader spectrum of activities operated in the different
         parts of the country. The project had been distributing crossbred dairy cows and pure-bred Friesian and Jersey breeding bulls
         and introduced improved methods of fodder production in the project areas (MOA/SDDP, 1996). According to the 1999 SDDP report
         of the Oromia Regional Government, the project had distributed 167 in calf heifers and 58 breeding bulls to contact farmers
         at Selale area. The number of crossbred dairy cows at Selale area increased to 342 and in addition, 4859 cows were mated with
         improved bulls from which 1093 calves had been born.
         		
      </p>
				<p>However, according to EARO1 (2001), the genetic improvement activities for dairy production in Ethiopia were constrained by
         a number of factors. Climatic stress in the form of erratic and inadequate rainfall; low fodder yield potential and high price
         for concentrate and susceptibility to a wide variety of serious diseases detrimentally affect the productivity of genetically
         improved dairy cattle specially the upgraded ones. Poor education and management expertise of farmers have also been hindrances
         in the implementation and maintenance of genetic improvement programs.

   Dairy cattle breeding policy in Ethiopia</head>
				<p>Despite the number of attempts in the past years to improve the genetic potential of the local dairy cows through crossbreeding, there has been no concrete and binding breeding
         policy with regard to the choice of the exotic breed types to be crossed with the indigenous animals and the optimal exotic
         blood level of the crosses to be attained in different production systems. 
      </p>
				<p>Even if it has not been implemented, there was a policy proposal, prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture in 1985 for Government
         decision to conduct an inventory of the livestock 
         
						<pagenumber edition="20"/>
					situation in the country and to set priorities regarding the types of livestock productions that are suitable for the different
         agro-ecological zones in the country. The proposal recommended to practice pure-breeding of Friesian cattle in urban dairy
         systems and large scale government farms and the selection of superior sires for AI. The proposal also suggested to produce
         and maintain Friesian and Jersey crossbreds (50%-75%) with indigenous cows and their distribution to small-holder farmers
         (Sjoberg, 1985). The choice of the Friesian and Jersey breeds was suggested to be linked with feed availability and the potential
         market for liquid milk. The policy recommends Jersey crosses for areas where milk had to be processed before reaching market
         and where the feed availability is less promising (Tesfaye, 1990). In addition, the proposal gave also significant consideration
         to the indigenous breeds and recommended their development for crossbreeding program and preservation. Furthermore, the policy
         proposal indicated that the National AI Scheme should adopt a strong and functional organization that can win the farmers
         confidence and also the necessity of a well organized national dairy recording scheme that works in close cooperation with
         the National AI Scheme.
      </p>
				<p>Recently, a draft proposal for a new livestock breeding policy has been prepared by the Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization
         (EARO) with the general objective of attaining sustainable increase in cattle productivity and socio-economic development
         (EARO1, 2001). Achievement of self-sufficiency in milk and milk products in both quality and quantity is one of the specific
         objectives of the draft policy. It has been indicated in the policy that a cattle breeding program in Ethiopia shall take
         into account the different agro-ecological zones and shall be implemented in accordance with socio-economic conditions prevailing
         in the areas. 
      </p>
				<p>The policy promotes the developed use of indigenous and exotic animal breeds, having superior production traits, that are relatively more tolerant to diseases, environmental stress and sub-optimal
         nutritional conditions. It also emphasizes the need for conservation of indigenous genetic resources. According to the policy,
         the national cattle breeding program shall have the following three components: 
      </p>
				<p>1. Cattle breed zoning is done based on the current distribution of breeds, objectives of livestock keeping, the physical
         environment, socio-economic conditions, prevailing farming system and availability of infrastructure (EARO 2, 2001). Cattle
         breeds are thus 
         
						<pagenumber edition="21"/>
					located to zones that suit their biology so that productivity is optimized. The policy also recommends the preparation of appropriate laws and regulations to restrict some
         breeds to some zones for specific purposes. 
      </p>
				<p>2. The draft policy recommends four alternatives of breeds to be used: indigenous, exotic, crossbred and synthetic. It is proposed that the indigenous cattle shall be left to prosper to preserve the indigenous gene pool and efforts should be made to improve their utilization within their system environment.
         The use of acclimatized exotic breeds that are selected and bred under local conditions has also been suggested. Crossbred
         cattle whose exotic blood level ranging within 50-62.5% shall be used to avoid the adaptation problem. The policy encourages
         governmental and non-governmental institutions to develop synthesized breeds that are targeted for certain production environments
         that require multipurpose breeds (EARO 2, 2001). 
      </p>
				<p>3. As to the breeding methods, pure-breeding is recommended to improve desirable traits. An open nucleus breeding program
         has been indicated in the draft policy to be appropriate for subsistence production systems in Ethiopia. Pure-breeding and
         multiplication of exotic breeds using more promising and improved tropical breeds is recommended for all high potential intensive
         dairy areas. Crossbreeding of indigenous breeds with exotic breeds, integrated with performance recording and selection program
         within the local cattle, is the second option mentioned in the draft policy. It is stressed that potential breeds for cross
         breeding should be identified and tagged to facilitate follow-ups and the crossbreeding program shall be monitored and evaluated
         regularly. The third option is rotational crossbreeding: using exotic and local breeds in alternate generations to take advantage
         of changing market demands (EARO 2, 2001).
      </p>
				<p>
         			Considering all the above three components of the breed improvement program for Ethiopia, the draft policy proposes, therefore,
         intensive dairying for high rainfall, tse-tse free, peri-urban, highly populated and accessible areas. According to the draft
         policy semi-intensive dairying is most suited for medium rainfall, medium altitude, tse-tse free, medium population density,
         peri-urban and accessible areas. Pure temperate dairy breeds such as Friesian and Jersey and their high grade crosses shall
         be promoted as being the best for both the intensive and semi-intensive dairying. Dairy ranching with crosses of indigenous
         and temperate dairy breeds up to F
         			1
         			 and tropical dairy breeds like Sahiwal, Red 
         			
         
						<pagenumber edition="22"/>
					
         			Sindhi and Kenana, is most suited for low rainfall, rural, tse-tse free and lowland areas. Extensive multi-purpose production
         systems are most suited for low rainfall, medium to low altitude, rural areas, low population density areas and accessible
         areas. The use of improved indigenous breeds as a development and genetic resource conservation strategy shall be adopted.
         In addition, synthetic breeds shall be developed for milk, meat and draft purposes and disease resistance (EARO 2, 2001).
         
         		
      </p>
				<p>Furthermore, the draft policy suggests sanctions to be imposed on the importation of genetic materials, including live animal,
         semen, ova and embryo, that are not verified to be free of any disease and genetic defects by a designated authority. The
         policy also restricts the importation and use of breeds other than those included in the list of suitable breeds for widespread
         use, that is prepared and updated regularly by the designated authority. Other breeds not appearing on the list shall only
         be allowed into the country for restricted use on designated locations like experimental stations and specialized production
         units (EARO 2, 2001).

   Review of the organization and efficiency of bull mating and AI schemes</head>
				<subsection>
					<head>
      
   
         			Natural mating
         		
      </head>
					<p>The use of bulls for natural service remains widespread even in areas where artificial insemination has proven to be very
         efficient. Many farmers believe that pregnancy rates are higher when a bull is used. The use of natural service may be indicated
         when personnel are inefficient to perform the tasks associated with heat detection and the techniques of AI, when long term
         genetic gain is of minor importance and when local conditions do not provide the infrastructure necessary for successful AI
         (Wattiaux, 1998).
      </p>
					<p>Selecting for breeding soundness of bulls</p>
					<p>
         			In undertaking natural mating, the bull must be morphologically and functionally sound. Testicles should have a distinct neck
         and should not be fibrotic or flaccid in consistency. This is essential because testicles must be a reasonable distance away
         from the internal body temperature. A scrotal circumference of 30cm and 34 cm is recommended for 15 months old and 24 months
         old Friesian bulls respectively (Jensen, 1997). 
         			Azage et al. 
         			(1997) indicated that there is a direct relationship between scrotal circumference and semen production. Bulls should also
         have good body condition and have morphologically 
         			
         
							<pagenumber edition="23"/>
						
         			sound feet and legs and healthy eyes to perform the service properly. A breeding bull is required also to have a good libido
         or serving capacity. Mickelson (1990) reported that the serving capacity of a bull is positively correlated with the proportion of heat detected cows. Differences in pregnancy
         rates were also associated with high, medium and low serving capacities of bulls (Chenoweth, 2000). If conditions allow, it
         is also essential to perform a rectal examination for abnormalities of accessory sex organs and to do semen evaluation tests.
         Furthermore, farmers must be careful to select preferably a crossbred between the local and improved breeds for cows that are small and
         local type, which has a greater probability of siring small calves which will not cause problems at calving time (Lee et al.,
         1998). 
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			
         				
         			
         			Managing a breeding bull
         		
      </p>
					<p>Appropriate attention should be given to factors affecting fertility of bulls that include unbalanced nutrition (under feeding
         and over feeding) and diseases. Adequate nutrition is vital, since it hastens puberty and body development. It is also important
         to keep in mind that overfeeding can lead to reduced libido (Sprott et al., 1998). Bulls should also be tested for venereal
         diseases like Brucellosis, Trichomonosis and Vibriosis that affect fertility and culled if they react positively. In addition,
         prevention measures like vaccination and deworming should be undertaken against other diseases that influence fertility indirectly
         (Sprott et al., 1997).
      </p>
					<p>It is important to undertake a regular fertility test for bulls to verify their external physical soundness, reproductive
         health (congenital and inflammatory problems), scrotal circumference and semen quality. Jensen (1997) indicated that up to
         20% of all bulls have less than optimum fertility. To avoid undesired mating, farmers should castrate all other bulls they
         have and prevent outside bulls from coming into the herd (Lee et al., 1998).
      </p>
					<p>Another factor to be considered is the temperament of breeding bulls which is genetically determined and is also affected
         by management. Viciousness makes bulls unmanageable and it is often the result of confinement and ill treatment. Proper daily
         handling, firm training and exercise make most bulls fairly tractable and easily controlled (Chenoweth, 2000). 
      </p>
					<p>
						
							<pagenumber edition="24"/>
						Bulls are culled for reasons such as low performing offspring, morphological deformities, eye problems, and age related problems
         of low quality semen and inadequate serving capacities (Sprott et al, 1997). 
      </p>
					<p>Organization of natural mating</p>
					<p>Organization of natural mating includes the required number of bulls, service interval, service length and replacement rate,
         heat detection skills, times of service, and mating record keeping. Barett and Larkin (1974) recommended 30-40 cows per bull under traditional method in which bulls run
         with the cows in one herd. Sambraus (1978) reported that, in temperate climates dual purpose bull serve on average 12 times
         a day over a period of several weeks. For hand mating system in which a bull is kept separated from the cows and mating is done at owner's discretion, a bull-cow
         ration of 1: 50-60 is recommended by Barrett and Larkin (1974). Zumbach and Peters (2000) suggested based on the recommendations of Barrett and Larkin (1974) a mating period
         of eight weeks with which eight cows can be served per week. 
      </p>
					<p>Breeding bulls should be replaced to avoid inbreeding. Previous works recommend not to use a bull for more than two to four
         years in a herd without replacement or switching with bulls from other sites (Lee et al, 1998 and IIRR, 2000). 
         		
      </p>
					<p>The hand mating system requires accurate heat detection skills and proper timing of services by the farmers. In a controlled
         breeding experiment in Sri Lanka, most farmers were unaware that their animals were displaying estrous cycles (Abeyratne et
         al. (1983). Esslemont et al (1985) recommended that it is useful to watch for heat three or four times a day, leaving not
         more than 8 hours between visits in order to improve heat detection rates up to 80%. Cows in heat must be served at the right
         time. Robert (1971) recommended that cows seen in estrus in the morning should be served that same day while those showing
         estrus later in the day should be served the next morning.

         			Efficiency of natural mating
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Naidoo et al. 
         			(1981) reported in Mauritius that natural mating was more effective than AI with 91% of calving intervals being less than
         14 months compared with only 49 % from AI. The work of Hailmariam et al. (1994) also indicated that the calving interval of
         Boran cows served by Boran bulls were shorter compared to those cows served by AI.

         			Reproductive technologies
      </head>
					<p>There are a number of reproductive technologies being applied to transfer desirable genetic materials. These include Artificial
         Insemination (AI), Embryo Transfer (ET), Ovum Pick-up (OPU), In-Vitro Maturation and Fertilization (IVM/IVF) and Cloning (FAO,
         2000). Of these only AI is the most commonly used technique in developing countries. 
         		
      </p>
					<block>
						<head>
      
   Artificial insemination</head>
						<p>AI is an essential technique in breeding programs with progeny testing. According to Wittiaux (1998), AI provides the opportunity
         to choose sires that are proven to transmit desirable traits to the next generation and minimizes the risk of spreading sexually
         transmitted diseases and genetic defects. So far artificial insemination using frozen semen has played an important role in
         increasing genetic progress by upgrading the reproductive rate of the male. It increases the selection intensity since less
         bulls are needed and this is the basis for selection progress. Zumbach and Peters (2000) estimated that 1820 cows can be inseminated
         by a bull using deep frozen semen. 
      </p>
						<p>Despite the wide application and success of AI throughout the developed world, the success rate in African and other developing
         countries is still low owing to a number of technical, system related, financial and managerial problems (Azage et al, 1995).
         Among the technical constraints are poor heat detection skills, communication and transport problems that hamper timely insemination,
         poor semen collection and storage technology and handling procedures that affect semen quality, and inefficiency of AI technicians.
         Other system related problems include small herds, disperse locations, limited production intensity and affordable cost. Due
         to the poor financial capabilities of the countries means of communication and infrastructure are insufficient. It would also
         be difficult for the countries to bear costs for the production of liquid nitrogen and purchase of necessary equipments. The
         financial problem is further aggravated by the poor management of AI operations (FAO 2000).
      </p>
						<p>According to the report of Chupin and Schuh (1992), AI coverage, semen production per year and AI applications per inseminator
         in Africa remains low. The same report indicated that the average AI applications per year per country in Africa is 30637
         which is far below the values for Asian, Latin America and Near East countries (Table 3.1). 
      </p>
						<p>

							In addition, the pregnancy rate in AI scheme does not exceed 45% in Africa and the conception rate to first service was 48%
         in zebu cows kept at the Ministry of Agriculture Ranch in Ethiopia (Mukasa-Mugerwa et al. 1991a).

   Embryo transfer</head>
						<p>Embryo transfer in conjunction with multiple ovulation and estrus synchronization is a more advanced reproductive technology.
         The main advantage of ET is a higher selection among the females and more accurate breeding value estimation. Siedel (1989)
         estimated that embryo transfer could enhance the rate of genetic gain in the dairy industry from the female side by 3 to 4
         fold. Its application is limited to developed countries because it is costly and requires highly developed technical skills.
         The application of ET in Africa has been, therefore, limited to research and development institutions. The technique have
         been applied in Africa at ILRAD to improve and multiply the N'Dama breed, which is indigenous in west Africa and is resistant
         to Trypanasomosis. ILCA also initiated an embryo transfer program at the Debre Zeit Research Station primarily on zebu cattle
         with the objectives of producing animals for research purposes and as a supportive tool for other research projects (Azage
         et al, 1995).

   Reproductive technology in Ethiopia</head>
						<p>The most commonly and widely used reproductive technology in Ethiopia for over three decades is AI. According to the information
         released from the Artificial Insemination Center in 1995, AI was introduced to Ethiopia in the early 1930's and then interrupted
         by the II world war (NAIC, 1995). The activity was resumed in Addis Ababa and the 
         
								<pagenumber edition="27"/>
							surrounding by the then Dairy Development Agency (DDA) that had been operating between 1958-1963. Since 1967 the AI was effectively
         and widely applied by the former Chilalo Agricultural Development Unit (CADU) in the present Arsi zone of Oromia. In addition,
         other institutions like the former Wolayta Agricultural Development Unit (WADU), Alemaya College of Agriculture, Institute
         of Agricultural Research (IAR) and the International Livestock Center for Africa (ILCA) had also been using AI in various
         areas of the country. 
      </p>
						<p>The National Artificial Insemination Center (NAIC) was established in 1981, under the Animal and Fisheries Resources Development
         Main Department (AFRDMD) of the Ministry of Agriculture with the mandate of organizing and coordinating AI activities as well as directing the breeding program at a national level (Azage et al., 1995)
         
      </p>
						<p>The information released from the AI center in 1995 indicates that the Center has been operating with 58 staff members of
         which 30 are technical and 28 are supportive staff. In 1995, the AI service operated with 86 technicians in 86 sites of 7
         regions of the country. The center is involved in semen and liquid nitrogen production, provision of regular group and individual
         training on AI to technicians and farmers, and dairy recording system. 
      </p>
						<p>The AI field service is currently carried out by AI technicians that are trained by the Center and assigned at the agricultural
         offices of the different regions of the country. The AI field service operates using three strategies. The first and widely
         used system is a daily round with which inseminators using motor bikes visit farms, villages and crush sites along side the
         main road. In this system, one AI technician covers an average of 50-60 km per day. The second system is called Static point
         with which AI technicians are stationed on farms where a large number of animals are kept. This is mainly practiced in large
         dairy farms, cattle collection centers (cows and heifers collected for insemination purposes for an average period of 3 months),
         and in cattle improvement and multiplication ranches. The third system operates on telephone call basis and this service is
         rendered in urban areas where telephone services are available.
      </p>
						<p>Available data on annual semen production and distribution over the last ten years show no consistent trend. Figure 3.1 shows
         the number of straws produced and distributed in the years between 1984-1994.

						<p>The Center produced and distributed also about 100, 000 l of liquid nitrogen between 1984 and 1993 . Although it is not consistent,
         the production of liquid nitrogen shows an increasing trend through the years 1984-1994 (Figure 3.2).

						<p>The training and extension services of the Center include organization of seminars and workshops at different levels, dissemination
         of relevant information on AI to the public 
         
								<pagenumber edition="29"/>
							through mass-media, and regular and in-service training courses for AI technicians. The Center has trained 259 technicians
         from 1984 to 2000.
      </p>
						<p>Although the information collected is not complete and inconsistent, the center has a dairy recording system to evaluate the
         performances of AI bulls, to give technical and managerial advice to dairy farmers, to provide reliable and up-to date information
         on identifying bull dams to select breeding bulls of high pedigree records and to perform progeny testing of selected bulls.

						<p>Little information is available on the effectiveness of AI under field condition except for some research related results
         obtained by ILRI on the performance of AI at the Gobe Ranch in Ethiopia and reports compiled by the National AI Center based
         on field reports. The only information available from the National AI Center (1995) indicates that a total of 265238 inseminations
         have been performed during 1967-1994 by different institutions. The average national value for services per conception is
         2.4. Mukassa-Mugrwa et al. (1991a) reported that only 1.6% of the cows, that were served with AI at the Gobe Ranch in Ethiopia,
         calved annually and the postpartum anestrus averaged 304 days. However, a report compiled and released by the Center indicated
         the average value for non-return rate (NRR) (60-90 days) and number of services per conception for the years from 1992 to 1994 to be 77.1% and 2.68 respectively. The values for NRR ranged from 64% to 86% and that of NSPC ranged from 1.14 to 4.8. Figure 3.3 depicts
         the total inseminations performed and total pregnancies attained through AI per year for the years from 1984 to 2000.

					<p>The lactation milk yield and days in milk of indigenous, crossbred and exotic cattle in Ethiopia reported by previous researchers
         are compiled in Table 3.2. The milk production potential of indigenous breeds of cattle is very low. In addition, milk production
         potential of temperate breeds in the tropical environments is higher than the indigenous breeds, but this yield is still far
         below the genetic potential. Therefore, crossbreeding of the indigenous breeds with temperate exotic breeds has been practiced

         			In most cases the first cross generation (F
         			1
         			), usually from native dams mated with exotic sires, have been successful. However, further upgrading by back crossing to
         the temperate breeds were not encouraging. Cunningham (1991) indicated that the possible explanation for the low productivity
         of F
         			2
         			 is the idea that blocks of genes giving favorable epistatic effects in the parental breeds and the F
         			1
         			 may be broken up in the F
         			2 
         			and subsequent generations.

         			Heritablity values for milk yield have been estimated to be 25%, 11-26%, 5-7.8%, 9-13% by Funk (1992), Ribas et al. (1999),
         Ageeb and Hayes (2000) and Mackinnon et al. (1996), respectively. Kiwuwa et al. (1983) reported that breed, parity status
         and year of calving significantly affect lactation milk yield and length. According to Kiwuwa (1983) indigenous breeds had
         lower lactation milk yields and lengths than F
         			1
         			 crosses while crosses of 50% Friesian and 50% Zebu , 50% Friesian and 50% Arsi and 75% Friesian and 25% Zebu had the highest
         and nearly the same value of milk production. Milk production 
         			
         
							<pagenumber edition="32"/>
						
         			also increased with parity status but up to the third lactation. The same results on the effect of parity status on lactation
         milk yield of Barca breeds (indigenous breeds) kept on station had been reported by Debre Zeit Agricultural Research Center
         (DZARC) (Goshu, 1981).
         		
      </p>
					<p>The effects of year of calving had been attributed to the change in management and feeding conditions during the years. According
         to a report by Tawah et al. (1999), lactation performance of pure breed Arsi and crosses with Friesian kept at Assela station
         in the Arsi region of Ethiopia, was not affected by pre-partum supplementation with concentrate mixes, however, it was significantly
         and positively affected by postpartum concentrate supplementation. Similarly, a mean increment of milk yield by 35% was also
         recorded by Little (1987) after supplementation with noug cake (Guizotia abyssinica). The same result was also reported by
         Kurtu (1999).

							Heritability of age at first calving is generally low, indicating that this trait is highly influenced by environmental factors.
         Cassle (2001) reported a heritability value of 14% for age at first calving in Holstein cattle while Hailemariam (1994) reported
         a heritability value of 7.5% in Boran cattle in Ethiopia. Trail and Gregory (1981) found no significant difference in AFC
         between Boran and Sahiwal heifers on a ranch in the Kenya Rift Valley. On the other hand Dennis and Thiongane (1978) reported
         that Gobra (Senegal Fulani) heifers kept on pasture and fed balanced concentrate supplement calved at earlier age (30 months) than unsupplemented heifers. Moreover, Miranda et al. (1982) and Hailemariam and Kassamersha (1994) found that age at first calving was significantly
         affected by the year and month of birth in Brazilian Nellore heifers and Ethiopian Boran cows, respectively.

   Calving interval</head>
						<p>Calving interval is probably the best indicator of a cow's reproductive efficiency. Estimates of calving interval in zebu
         cattle range from 12.2 to 26.6 months (Mukassa-Mugrewa, 1989). Table 3.4 presents some values of calving interval for cattle
         in Ethiopia estimated by different authors.
      </p>
						<p>Calving interval has a very low heritability. Cassell (2001) reported a heritability value of 3% for first calving interval
         in Holstein dairy cattle and Hailemariam (1994) reported a heritability value of 3.7% for Boran in Ethiopia. Nutritional conditions
         that vary seasonally and yearly have major effects on calving interval (Oliveira (1974), Oyedipe (1982) and Hailemariam and
         Kassamersha (1994)). Calving interval is also influenced by parity. In zebu cattle, calving interval is longest in first calf
         heifers and older cows and shortest in cows of intermediate age (6-9 years) (Mukassa-Mugrewa, (1989) and Plasse et al., (1972).

						<p>Number of services per conception depends largely on the breeding system used. It is higher under uncontrolled natural breeding
         than hand-mating and artificial insemination. Values of NSPC greater than 2 should be regarded as poor (Mukassa-Mugrewa, 1989).

         while Sharma and Batnagar (1975) found a significant effect of parity on NSPC in Sahiwal, Red Sindhi and Tharparkar cattle.
         
         			Moreover, Azage et al. 
         			(1981) found that NSPC was lower for animals from wet areas than those from drier areas in Ethiopia.

   Family size and composition </head>
					<p>Abdinasir (2000) found a mean household size of 7.9 persons with 61.5% being children in two areas in Arsi. In another region
         in the Central Highlands of Ethiopia, Niftalem (2000) reported a mean household size of 5.6 persons and 4.6 persons in Inewari
         and Debre Berhan, respectively, and Getachew et al. (1993) found an average house hold size of 5 persons and 5.6 persons at
         Dogollo and Inewari, respectively.

   Labor distribution</head>
					<p>According to Getachew et al. (1993) there is division of labor by gender and age. Livestock husbandry practices are shared
         among members of the household. According to the work, the responsibility of women includes milking of cows, barn cleaning
         and dung cake making while men are involved in forage collection and livestock feeding. Herding of livestock is mostly the
         responsibility of children. This fact is supported by the work of Tekalign et al. (1993) and the final report of MOA and FINNIDA
         (1996), that was prepared on the activities of the Selale Peasant Dairy Development Pilot Project.

   Land holding</head>
					<p>The land size allotted to individual farmers by a Peasant Association (PA) as per the Land Reform Declaration of 1975, depended
         on family size, fertility of the land, the number of PA members and the total land area available within the PA (Getachew
         et al, 1993). Table 3.6 contains the summary of reports on the land holding of households in the Central Highlands of Ethiopia.
      </p>
					<p>Abdinasir (2000) reported significant effects of farm size, cattle holding and sheep holding on the cultivated land size.
         This work indicated that cultivated land size increased with farm size at Bilalo and Lemmu and households that own less than
         5 TLU of cattle, 
         
							<pagenumber edition="36"/>
						cultivated less area than those with larger cattle holding in Bilalo. In addition, households with one or less TLU of sheep
         holding, cultivated less area than those with larger sheep holdings. Niftalem (2000) also reported that cultivated land size
         significantly increased with farm size.

   Objectives of livestock keeping </head>
					<p>The most important objective of keeping livestock in the Ethiopian highlands is the use of oxen as draught animals (Tekalign
         et al, 1993 and Getachew et al, 1993). Milk, meat and hides are relatively less important byproducts. In addition, manure
         is collected, dried and used as a major household fuel. Cows are kept to produce oxen needed for draught and are also milked with the milk being consumed mostly by young children.
         Surplus milk and other livestock products are often sold to finance the purchase of basic household commodities (Tekalign
         et al, 1993). Sheep are economically important in the highlands in 
         
							<pagenumber edition="37"/>
						that they are sources of investment, security and cash (Getachew et al, 1993). Equines are kept mainly for packing and transporting
         purposes (Tekalign et al, 1993).

					<p>The work of Abdinasir (2000) indicated that the mean value for cattle herd size at Bilalo and Lemmu areas are 8.57 TLU and
         10.38 TLU respectively. According to his work the herd was dominated by oxen that comprised 43.2% of the herd followed by
         cows that comprise 30.3% of the herd. A similar result was found by Tekalign et al. (1993) who reported that oxen and cows
         comprise 43.87% and 21.93% of the herd at Ada, respectively. According to the final report of the MOA and FINNIDA (1996) on
         the activities of the Selale Peasant Dairy Development Pilot Project, cows comprised only 11.2% of the cattle herd at Selale
         area. Abdinasir (2000) indicated that herd size increases significantly with household size, cultivated area and grazing area.

   Livestock feeding </head>
					<p>In Ethiopia, native pasture is the major source of feed for ruminants both is the area of mixed farming system and pastoralism,
         although it is neither quantitatively nor qualitatively adequate to support profitable animal production (Seyom et al, 1997).
         Abdinasir (2000) indicated that in Arsi area the average grazing hours during the rainy and dry seasons were 10 and 9 hours
         respectively. 
      </p>
					<p>
						
							<pagenumber edition="38"/>
						In addition, teff and wheat straws are also important sources of livestock feed in the highland Vertisol areas. Barley and
         oat straws are also important in areas where they are produced. Straw supplementation is commonly restricted to work-oxen
         and lactating cows. But grass hay is commonly fed to working oxen and milking cows during the dry season. The amount of straw
         fed depends on the work expected from the ox. During the peak period, on average 5 to 10 kg of straw is fed to an ox each
         day (Getachew et al, 1993). 
         		
      </p>
					<p>Since concentrate supplements are not readily available and are relatively expensive, they are rarely used in animal production
         (Solomon and Solomon, 1995). Instead, on-farm grown forage legumes are suggested as good alternatives (Nnadi and Haque, 1988,
         ESAP, 1999). However, the various milling by-products obtained from processing wheat and oil seed meals are of high demand
         as livestock feed for state farms, city dairy holders, and to a lesser extent for small dairy cooperatives (Alemayehu, 1995).
         Molasses, obtained from the sugar industry in Ethiopia, is being used mainly by beef producers and to some extent by dairy
         producers in and around the major cities. 
      </p>
					<p>Farmers at Selale area were found to have three main feed resources; grazing, hay and straw that supply a minimum of 90% of
         the total dry matter intake. In addition, it was reported that grazing was practiced by 95% of the project contact farmers
         and 90% of the cows grazed on average 6.6 hours per day. Supplementation with straw was practiced mainly during the long rainy
         season between June and August (MOA and FINNIDA, 1996). 
      </p>

   Livestock housing </head>
					<p>The traditional livestock husbandry practiced across the Ethiopian highlands is similar. Livestock are kept in a 'kraal' during
         the night. During the day time, they are herded on communal pasture, private grazing lands or in a stubble depending on the
         season (Getachew et al, 1993). Improved type of housing using barns constructed from locally available and cheap materials
         is being practiced mainly by urban and peri-urban small holder dairy farmers owning crossbred dairy cattle.

   Status of Brucellosis in Ethiopia</head>
				<p>Infections of the bovine genital tract affect fertility by altering its environment, so that there may be impaired sperm transport,
         sperm death or embryonic and fetal deaths. 
         
						<pagenumber edition="39"/>
					Venereal diseases are among these genital tract infections that are transmissible through mating. Brucellosis is one of the
         most important venereal diseases in that it causes abortion and significantly impairs fertility. The disease also causes reduction
         in milk production. Further importance of the disease include its public health significance and unfavorable effect on export trade of livestock products. 
      </p>
				<p>The fact that it is transmissible through natural service and the traditional management systems use indiscriminately locally
         available bulls for breeding makes it more important than other infectious causes of infertility. 
      </p>
				<p>
         			A summary of values of the prevalence of Brucellosis in Ethiopia is presented in Table 3.8. The disease seems to be more prevalent
         in improved breeds than in locals (Abebe, 1989). In addition, Yilkal (1998) reported that the prevalence was significantly
         higher in farms that keep more than 100 animals (9.3%) than in those that keep less than 50 animals (3.3%). 
         			Jiwa et al. 
         			(1996) reported higher prevalence rate in dairy (6.3%) and ranch animals (15.5%) than in animals kept under extensive grazing
         conditions (4.3%) in the Lake Victoria Zone of Tanzania.

					<p>
         			Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, lies between 8

         			 55&#8217; and 9
         			o
         			 07&#8217; north and 38

         			 50&#8217; east situated in the center of a well drained plateau and surrounded by hills and mountains, between 2000 meters and
         3000 meters above sea level (Figure 4.1.). The rainy season extends from Mid-June to Late-September with an annual average
         rainfall of 1000mm. The average annual daily temperature is 16
         			o
         			c. The city covers an extensive area of 216 km
         			2
         			 and has a population of more than 3 million inhabitants. According to a recent census undertaken by the Addis Ababa Region
         Agricultural Bureau (1996) a total of 5167 small, medium and large dairy farms are found and 34649450 liters of milk are produced
         annually. A total of 37426 local and crossbred cows are available within the region out of which 20% are indigenous and 46.5%
         are crossbred.

   Selale(rural setting)</head>
					<p>Selale is a common name for the area that is currently the Northwest Shoa Zone of the Oromia Regional Administration in Ethiopia.
         It is located 190 km north west of Addis Ababa (Figure 4.1). It covers 1174500 ha of land from which 40% is crop land, 25%
         is grazing land, 13% is forest and bush area, 7% is construction area and 15% is unproductive land. The human population in
         the area is 1242366 . There are 210215 households in the region that practice predominantly mixed farming. The cattle population
         is about 1113200. 42% of the area is highland that is suitable for crop cultivation and livestock husbandry and the herd structure
         is characterized by a higher number of cows. The lowland area constitutes 35% and farming activities represent the largest
         part of the small holders income. The herd structure in the lowland areas is thus dominated by oxen. Selale has 2 annual rainy
         seasons: from February-May (short rainy season) and from June-October (long rainy season) (Tittarelli, F, 1990). 
      </p>
					<p>This study concentrates on the highland parts of Selale, with an altitude over 2800 meters above sea level considered to be a high potential cereal-livestock zones where dairy
         activities play a significant role in the livelihood of farmers in the area. Considering the potential of the area and the economic significance
         of dairy production to the local 
         
							<pagenumber edition="41"/>
						community there have been repeated efforts by governmental and non-governmental aid organizations to improve the dairy productivity.
         This area has also better access to livestock development services (governmental and non-governmental) and milk markets than other rural areas. Due to the above mentioned reasons and the economic capacity of the peasants small-holder dairy production with crossbred
         dairy cattle is a common practice in the area.

         			Sampling procedures
      </head>
				<p>
         			A total of 120 dairy cow owners and 20 breeding bull owners were included in this study. 80 of the dairy cow owners and all
         the breeding bull owners were selected from the North-West-Shoa Zone (commonly called 
         			Selale
         			) of the Oromia Region. Two 
         			Woredas
         			 (administrative units) namely 
         			Mulo-Sululta
         			 and 
         			
         			Degem
         			 and two peasant associations (PA) of each 
         			Woreda
         			 were selected randomly. All the contact farmers of the SDDP available in each PA were included in the sample while a random selection has been performed
         to select farmers that are not direct beneficiaries of the SDDP. The random selection was done from the list of farmers available
         at the Zonal Agricultural Office. 40 dairy cow owners were selected randomly from Addis Ababa. The North-East zone of the
         capital, that includes areas that are commonly called 
         			Shola
         			 and 
         			Kaliti, 
         			was selected. The random selection was done from the list of dairy cow owners available at the Zonal Agricultural Office.
         25 small scale, 8 medium scale and 7 large scale dairy farms were selected in an attempt to include all levels of dairy production
         in Addis Ababa. Tables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 contain the number of dairy farms, dairy cows and breeding bulls included in the study
         at the different study areas.

   Questionnaire survey</head>
					<p>Detailed structured questionnaires (see annex) were prepared and used to collect information from dairy cow and b7reeding bull owners in a one visit interview. The questionnaires
         were pre-tested to check clarity and appropriateness of the questions. Some of the information collected through interview
         were supported by observation.
      </p>
					<p>The data collected through interview are classified as follow: farming system characteristics, estimated performance of dairy
         cattle owned by the farm, breeding practices by farmers, natural mating organization and farm incidences of abortion and awareness
         of farmers on venereal disease.
      </p>
					<p>
         			Farming system characteristics 
         			: information on family status, level of education of farmers, family size and composition, land holding, crop yield per hectare,
         livestock herd size and composition, cattle herd size and composition, objectives of dairying, dairy cattle feeding, dairy
         cattle management and constraints of dairying and labor distribution were collected.
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Estimated performances of dairy cattle owned
         			: information were collected on estimated daily milk yield at the beginning, middle and end of lactation, lactation length,
         age at first calving, calving interval and services per-conception.
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Breeding practices by dairy cow and breeding bull owners
         			: information concerning farmers' opinion concerning the preferred performance traits, sources of information to acquire dairy
         cows and options preferred to improve dairy productivity were collected.
         		
      </p>
					<p>

         			Organization and efficiency of bull mating
         			: information pertaining sources and use pattern of breeding bulls, management of bulls, number of farms getting bull service, number of cows getting the bull service, number of first, second and third services; time required to go to
         the bull station, times of service, price of bull service per-conception, mating record keeping, non-return rate and number of offspring obtained were collected.
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			Awareness of farmers on venereal diseases prevalence, prevention and control
         			: information concerning the awareness of farmers on the risk of venereal diseases, knowledge of farmers on the name and symptoms

         and source of replacement bulls, feeding and housing of breeding bulls, selection of breeding bulls, performance testing and
         incidence and control of venereal diseases, cost of production per semen straw and price of AI service per-conception.
      </p>
					<p>Data recorded by the Center for the last five years were also used as a source of information for number of semen straws produced
         per year, number of semen straws discarded per year, semen quality parameters and number of first, second, third and fourth inseminations performed per year (for Addis Ababa)
         and non-return rates (for Addis Ababa).

					<p>Blood samples were collected from all the dairy cows (713) and breeding bulls (20) owned by the farmers included in this study
         and all breeding bulls owned and that are currently used for semen collection (14) by the National AI Center. The blood samples
         were collected using 9 ml Serum-vacutainer-tubes, that are coated with clot activator, and 20G double end needles. The blood
         samples were let to stand for some time till they clot and 25 ul of serum was taken from each sample and mixed with 25 ul
         of Rose-Bengal Antigen on a Serum Agglutination Plate for Serum Agglutination Test. The mixture were checked for any level of serum agglutination that is considered to be positive.

   Estimated daily milk yield and lactation length</head>
					<p>Since the research was based on a one-visit interview, it was not possible to record milk yield at intervals, rather farmers
         were asked for the quantity of milk they milked from their cows during previous lactation periods at the beginning, at the
         middle and at the end of lactation. Daily milk yield at the beginning of lactation refers to the quantity of milk in liters
         the farmers milked daily from a cow during the first two to three months of lactation, daily milk yield in the middle of lactation
         refers to the quantity of milk the farmers milked daily from a cow for the next six months and daily milk yield at the end
         of lactation refers to the quantity of milk the farmers milked daily from a cow during the remaining months. In addition, the values for lactation length were recorded in months since most of the

						farmers didn&#8217;t have records and it was difficult for them to recall the lactation length in days.

         			Age at first calving was 
         			determined
         			 
         			from information on birth date and the time of first calving of their cows. Calving interval was calculated from information
         obtained on times of previous calving and last calving. Number of services per conception
         			 
         			represented the

   Description of farming system characteristics</head>
						<p>Descriptive statistics like mean, standard deviation and frequency distribution were used to describe the farming system characteristics
         in the different study areas. These include family size and composition, crop land holding, crop yield per hectare, grazing
         land holding, livestock herd size and composition, cattle herd size and composition, objectives of dairying, dairy cattle
         feeding, dairy cattle management, labor distribution and constraints of dairy production.

   Factors affecting estimated performances of dairy cattle</head>
					<p>GLM of the SPSS statistical software (SPSS for windows, release 10.05, 1999) has been used to analyze factors affecting estimated
         daily milk yield at three phases of lactation, lactation length , age at first calving, calving interval and number of service
         per conception. The factors were divided in two groups namely farming system characteristics and feeding regimes and were
         fitted in the following models.

         lowest mean was found in Addis Ababa with 5.58 persons (SD= 2.72). The family size ranged from 1 to 16 persons at Selale area
         while it ranged from 1 to 13 persons in Addis Ababa. In all study areas more than 75% of the households have a family size
         that ranged between 3 to 9 persons. Family members less than 20 years of age comprised 51. 5 % of the family at Selale area
         while 46.6 % of the family in Addis Ababa was composed of members under 20 years of age.

						<p>The crop land holdings were comparable at Mulo- Sululta and Degem, however, the grazing land holding per household at Muluo-Suluta
         was higher than that at Degem. The mean value for grain production at Degem was almost three times higher than that of Mulo-Sululta.
         In addition, 85% of the households produced less than 1 ton of grain at Mulo-Sululta while at Degem 42.5 % of the households produced less than 1 ton. Livestock holdings
         were rather similar in Mulo-Sululta and Degem. The values for land holding, crop production and livestock holdings other than
         cattle in Addis Ababa were not included in the results since there were only few cases with values of the above specified
         variables.

         herd was comparable at Mulo-Suluta and Degem. In both areas the livestock herd was dominated by cattle and sheep. Next to
         cattle and sheep asses comprised a significant portion of the livestock herd in both areas. Horses stood next to asses in

         cows with 50% or less exotic blood increased as the farm size decreased while those of 75% or more exotic blood increased
         with the increment of farm size. The lowest proportion of exotic cows was found in the small scale farms and it was comparable

         In Addis Ababa, 97.5% of the herds did not graze at all. The highest amount of crop residue was supplied to dairy cattle at
         Degem followed by Mulo-Sululta while no farm in Addis Ababa supplied crop residues. In general, farms at Mulo-Sululta and
         Degem supplement their dairy cows with a very small quantity of wheat bran and oil seed meal. At Mulo-Sululta and Degem only
         12.5% and 2.5% of the households supplement wheat bran, respectively, while 25% and 97.5% of the farms at Mulo-Sululta and Degem supplement oilseed meal, respectively. The quantity of oilseed meal supplemented was
         larger than that of wheat bran at Selale area. In Addis Ababa, dairy cattle were supplemented with relatively large quantities of wheat bran and oilseed meals. The quantity of hay given to dairy

         			 at Selale the main objective of keeping dairy cattle was to obtain income and provide food to the household. 92.9% of "SDDP contact farmers" and 64.4% of "SDDP follow farmers" at Mulo-Sululta and 88.2% of "SDDP contact farmers" and 91.3% of "SDDP follow farmers" at Degem said
         that they produced milk as a source of income and for household consumption. The remaining percentage of households in both
         areas said that they produce milk only for household consumption. In both areas all the households sold their milk to the
         dairy development enterprise for a price of 1.25 birr (0.15 EUR).
         		
      </p>
						<p>In Addis Ababa, the objective of keeping dairy cattle was mainly to obtain income. However, 92.8% of the small scale dairy farm owners said they produce milk for sale and household consumption. The price of milk in
         Addis Ababa varies from birr 2.50 to 2.75 per liter of milk and the market in Addis Ababa was more diversified including the DDE, individuals in the
         neighborhood and restaurants.

						<p>In addition, all "SDDP contact farmers" and 96.2% of " SDDP follow farmers" at Mulo-Sululta practiced a management based on
         partial grazing in which dairy cattle graze in the morning and spent the rest of the day and the night within their barns or corrals. At Degem,
         94.1% of "SDDP contact farmers" and 82.6% of "SDDP follow farmers" practiced the same type of management, however, dairy cows
         spent much of their time in their barns or near the farmers house.
      </p>
						<p>In Addis Ababa, 84% of small scale farms and all of the medium scale and large scale farms had barns. Most of the barns of
         the small scale and medium scale farms were constructed within the living compound of the households and, thus, were small
         and crowded. However, most of the large scale farms had a separate farm compound usually at the outskirts of the city and
         had well constructed and modern types of barns. 92.0%, 71.4% and 83.3% of small scale, medium scale and large scale farms,
         respectively, practiced a management system based on stall feeding with zero grazing.

   Constraints of dairy production </head>
						<p>Table 5.6 contains the percentages of the households that mentioned some constraints of dairy production at Selale area. Lack
         of livestock feed and livestock diseases were the most important constraints for "SDDP contact farmers" at Mulo-Sululta and
         Degem. On the other hand, livestock diseases were the most important constraints for "SDDP follow farmers" at Mulo-Suluta.
         At Degem, more than half of "SDDP contact farmers" found also the low genetic potential of dairy cows and lack of veterinary
         services as constraints. In addition, lack of livestock feed, livestock diseases, low genetic potential of dairy cows and
         lack of veterinary services were stressed as constraints by most of the households that are "SDDP follow farmers" at Degem.
      </p>
						<p>In Addis Ababa, lack of livestock feed was mentioned as the most important constraint by all the farm scales. 92%, 85.7% and
         83.3% of the small scale, medium scale and large scale farms, respectively, mentioned lack of livestock feed as a constraint.
         Disease was the 
         
								<pagenumber edition="62"/>
							second most important constraint that was mentioned by 68%, 57.1% and 83.3% of the small scale, medium scale and large scale
         farms respectively. A significant percentage of small scale farms (32%) also considered lack of labor as a constraint. Lack of veterinary service was mentioned as a constraint only by small scale farms (12%) while lack of livestock development services was mentioned only by medium scale (28.6%) and small scale (16%) farms.

						<p>In 85.7%, 78.6%, 85.7% and 85.7% of the households of "SDDP contact farmers" in Mulo-Sululta, the husbands were responsible for feeding, milking, breeding
         and health monitoring, respectively. Wives were responsible for herding in 71.4% of the households of "SDDP contact farmers".
         In "SDDP follow farmers", husbands were involved in 46.2% of the households in feeding and in 65.4% of all the households
         in milking, breeding, health monitoring and stable work. In this case, wives shared responsibilities for feeding (34.6%),
         breeding (26.9%), health monitoring (19.2%) and housing (26.9%) with husbands that had still the largest share of responsibility
         in all of the activities. Wives were also responsible for herding in most of the households of "SDDP follow farmers" (53.8%).
      </p>
						<p>At Degem, the proportions of responsibilities were almost the same as in Mulo-Sululta. In the households of "SDDP contact
         farmers" and "SDDP follow farmers", all responsibilities except herding were that of the husband. In most of the households,
         herding was the responsibility of wives.

							In Addis Ababa, in all of the large scale and medium scale farms and 60% of the small scale farms feeding of the dairy cattle was done by
         hired laborers. In more than 80% of the households of medium and large scale dairy farms, sons of the farmers were engaged
         with milking, breeding, health monitoring and stable work. In small scale dairy farms, the practices of milking and breeding
         were shared almost equally between husbands (36%) and sons (44%) and while husbands (64.4%) had the responsibility of health
         monitoring. Wives (32%) shared the stable work with sons (40%).

						<p>The least-squares means for factors affecting crop land size at Selale are indicated in Table 5.11. Cropland size slightly
         increased with the increment of family size, grazing land size and herd size. However, only grazing land size had a significant
         effect on crop land size.
      </p>
						<p>
							
								<pagenumber edition="66"/>
							The results of stepwise regression analyses, presented in Table 5.12, showed that crop land size had positive relations with
         grazing land size and herd size. 37% of the variation in crop land size could be explained by variations in grazing land size
         while the contribution of herd size was very small (2%).

   Factors affecting grazing land size at Selale</head>
						<p>Results of the analyses of variance for factors affecting grazing land size are presented in Table 5.13. Crop land size and
         herd size had significant (p&lt;0.01) effect on grazing land size owned by a household. Family size had no significant effect
         on grazing land size (p&gt;0.05).
      </p>
						<p>The lease-squares means for factors affecting grazing land size (Table 5.14) showed that grazing land size increased with
         crop land size and herd size. Although it had no significant effect, grazing land size decreased with family size. The results
         of stepwise regression analyses, presented in Table 5.15, revealed that grazing land size had positive relations with crop
         land size and herd size and 37% of the variation in grazing land size could be explained by crop land size alone.

   Factors affecting cattle herd size and composition at Selale</head>
						<p>Results of the analyses of variance for factors affecting cattle herd size and composition at Selale are presented in Table
         5.16. The results revealed that family size affected significantly cattle herd size (p&lt;0.05) while crop yield per hectare
         affected significantly the number of crossbred dairy cows (p&lt;0.05). Moreover grazing land size affected significantly herd
         size (p&lt;0.001). Cropland size did not have a significant effect on any of the dependent variables in this model (p&gt;0.05).

							The least-squares means for factors affecting cattle herd size and composition (Table 5.17), showed that herd size, number
         of cows and number of crossbred cows increased with family size and crop land size. In addition, the number of cows increased with the
         increment of crop yield per hectare. The trend of the number of crossbred cows was irregular with the increment of crop yield
         per hectare, however, there is an indication of increment. Furthermore, there was a tendency of increment in number of cows
         and herd size with grazing land size.
      </p>
						<p>The results of stepwise regression analyses for factors affecting herd size are presented in Tables 5.18. Grazing land size,
         family size and crop yield per hectare had positive effects on herd size and 25% of the variation in herd size could be explained
         by the variation in grazing land size alone.

   Factors affecting cattle herd size and composition in Addis Ababa</head>
						<p>Table 5.19 contains the results of the analyses of variance for factors affecting cattle herd size and composition in Addis
         Ababa. The results indicated that only the type of side line occupation affected cattle herd size (p&lt;0.01), number of cows
         (p&lt;0.05) and number of 75% crossbred cows (p&lt;0.05). Family size and level of education had no significant effect on cattle
         herd size and composition in Addis Ababa (p&gt;0.05).
      </p>
						<p>The least-squares means for factors affecting cattle herd size and composition in Addis Ababa (Figure 5.2), revealed that those households that do not have any other side line occupation had the largest herd size followed by those
         who had small businesses. Civil servants had the smallest herd size value. The largest value for the number of cows and the
         number of all levels of crossbred cows was recorded for those households with out sideline occupation. Households with small
         businesses had the second largest value for the number 
         
								<pagenumber edition="70"/>
							of 50% crossbred cows while civil servants had the second largest value for the number of cows with 75% or more exotic blood levels.

         			The results of analyses of variance for factors affecting concentrate supplementation at Selale are presented in Table 5.21.
         The results of analyses of variance revealed that length of grazing time and supplementation with crop residues, hay and beverage
         byproducts (
         			Atela
         			) were not significantly affected by any of the factors included in the model (p&gt;0.05). However, supplementation with concentrates
         was significantly affected by the affiliation to SDDP and crop yield per hectare (p&lt;0.05).

					<p>In addition, the genotype of dairy cows affected estimated daily milk yield, at all stages of lactation (p&lt;0.001), and lactation length
         (p&lt;0.01). However, grazing land size and herd 
         
							<pagenumber edition="75"/>
						size did not significantly affect estimated daily milk yield at all levels and lactation length (p&gt;0.05).
      </p>
					<p>The least-squares means for factors that affect estimated daily milk yield at three stages of lactation showed that dairy
         cows owned by "SDDP contact farmers" gave slightly more milk (5.0 liters) than those owned by "SDD follow farmers (4.2 liters)
         at the middle of lactation and had shorter lactation length than "SDDP follow farmers". Higher levels of estimated daily milk
         yield at the beginning and middle of lactation were reported when crop yield per hectare increased (Figure 5.3).

					<p>As it could be expected, higher estimated daily milk yields were obtained at all stages of lactation with the increment of
         exotic blood (Figure 5.4). The persistency of estimated daily milk yield through the three stages of lactation was also better
         for dairy cows with no or lower exotic blood. However, lactation length did not differ between cows of different exotic blood
         level but it was shorter in indigenous cows.

					<p>The results of the analyses of variance for factors affecting estimated daily milk yield and lactation length in Addis Ababa
         including farm scale and genotype of dairy cows are presented in Table 5.28. Estimated daily milk yield was affected significantly
         by farm scale (p&lt;0.001) and genotype of cows (p&lt;0.001) at all stages of lactation. Lactation length was significantly affected
         by farm scale (p&lt;0.01).

					<p>The least-squares means for factors that affect estimated daily milk yield at the three stages of lactation in Addis Ababa
         are presented in Figures 5.5 and 5.6. Estimated daily milk yield increased at all stages of lactation (Figure 5.5) and lactation length showed irregularity with the increment of farm size.
      </p>
					<p>Estimated daily milk yield increased also as the percentage of exotic blood increased and lactation length showed irregularity
         with the increment of exotic blood. Dairy cows with no or low exotic blood showed better persistency in estimated daily milk yield through the three stages of lactation (Figure 5. 6).

					<p>The least-squares means for factors that affect the estimated reproductive performance of dairy cattle in Addis Ababa are
         presented in Table 5.34. Age at first calving increased with the increment of farm size while calving interval decreased with
         the increment of level of education. The results also showed that dairy cows owned by civil servants calve more frequently
         than those owned by households with small businesses and with out sideline occupation.
      </p>
					<p>Table 5.35 contains the results of the analyses of variance for feeding regime factors that affect the estimated reproductive
         performance of dairy cows in Addis Ababa. The results indicated that age at first calving was significantly affected by supplementation
         with oilseed meal (p&lt;0.01) and hay (p&lt;0.01). Calving interval was significantly affected by all three types of supplementation.
         Number of services per-conception was significantly affected by wheat bran (p&lt;0.01) and oilseed meal (p&lt;0.001) supplementation.

					<p>Figure 5.7 contains the overall proportions of farmers that mentioned different sources of information for acquisition of
         dairy cattle at the different study areas. Most of the farmers at Mulo-Sululta (95%), Degem (82.5%) and Addis Ababa (75%)
         used individual performance information to acquire dairy cows. The second most important source of information mentioned by
         the farmers was the performance of the progeny of the cows at Mulo-Sululta (12.5%) and the performance of the dam of the cow
         at Degem (80%) and Addis Ababa (42.5%).

					<p>The results of chi-square statistics revealed that there was a significant variation between the study areas (p&lt;0.001) concerning
         the source of information to acquire dairy cattle. However, there were no significant variations between the two affiliation
         groups at Selale and the three farm scales in Addis Ababa (p&gt;0.05). Table 5.37 contains proportion of farmers at all the study
         areas using one or a combination of sources of information sources. Most of the farmers at Mulo-Sululta (87.5%) and Addis
         Ababa (57.5%) used only

						individual performance. At Degem, 57.5% of the farmers considered individual performance, dam's performance and progeny performance
         together.
      </p>
					<p>In the case of bulls, 84.7% of the bull owners at Mulo-Sululta and all the bull owners at Degem used dam performance as a
         source of information for acquisition of breeding bulls. The remaining proportion of farmers at Mulo-sululta used progeny
         performance. However, the variations between the study areas and the two affiliation groups were not significant (p&gt;0.05).

						<p>Figure 5.8 shows the proportions of farmers at all the study areas that mentioned different performance traits as their preferences.
         The most important preferred trait mentioned by farmers in all the study areas was high daily milk yield. It was mentioned
         by 97.5% of the farmers at Mulo-Sululta and Degem and by 92.5% of the farmers in Addis Ababa. High daily milk yield was followed
         by high fat content at Mulo-Sululta (60%), shorter age at first calving at Degem (55%) and Addis Ababa (42.5%). The third
         most frequently preferred trait was shorter age at first calving at Mulo-Sululta (35%), high fat content at Degem (20%) and
         longer lactation length in Addis Ababa (40%). The least considered performance trait was shorter calving interval at Mulo-Sululta
         (30%), Degem (17.5%) and Addis Ababa (5%).

         and in Addis Ababa (77.5%). At Degem, almost all the farmers (95%) considered a cow as best for milk production if it has
         a straight back. At Mulo-Sululta, triangular shape of the frame of a cow and straightness of the back of the cow was also
         considered by 32.5% and 5% of the farmers, respectively. At Degem, the second most important morphological characteristic
         considered was large udder of the cow (42.5%) followed by small head of the cow (15%) and triangular shape of the frame of
         the cow (12.5%). In Addis Ababa, the second most important morphological characteristic mentioned was straightness of the
         back of cows (45%) followed by triangular shape of the frame of the cow (15%) and large udder (12.5%).

      </head>
						<p>57.1% of the bull owners at Mulo-Sululta and 16.7% of the bull owners at Degem had the chance to select their own bulls. With
         respect to affiliation to SDDP, 90.9% of the "SDDP contact farmers" did not select their own bulls, which was provided by
         SDDP, while all the "SDDP follow farmers" selected their own bulls. A chi-square statistics result showed that, the differences
         between the study areas was not significant (p&gt;0.05) while the difference between the affiliation groups was significant (p&lt;0.001).
      </p>
						<p>Figure 5.10 contains the percentages of bull owners mentioning different preferred performance traits at Selale. All the bull
         owners both at Mulo-Sululta (100%) and Degem (100%) considered high daily milk yield as the most important preferred performance
         trait followed by high fat content at Mulo-Sululta (71.4%) and shorter age at first calving and calving interval at Degem
         ( 50%). Shorter age at first calving and high fat content were the third most important selection criteria mentioned at Mulo-Sululta
         (50%) and Degem (33.3%) respectively.

						<p>52.5%, 55% and 65% of the farmers at Mulo-Sululta, Degem and Addis Ababa, respectively, planned to attain higher milk yield
         through the introduction of cross breeds with higher exotic blood into their herd. A significant proportion of the farmers
         at Mulo-Sululta (45%), Degem (35%) and Addis Ababa (27.5%) were satisfied with the existing exotic blood level. The remaining

						<p>Almost all the farmers at Mulo-Sululta (97.5%) did not have plans of using either exotic breed cows or high grade cows to
         attain a shorter age at first calving. They believed that age at first calving could be improved with improved nutrition.
         However, 77.8% of the farmers at Degem and 85.7% of the farmers in Addis Ababa planned to improve the age at first calving
         of their dairy cattle herd through the introduction of high grade cows into their farms. The remaining proportions of farmers
         at Degem and in Addis Ababa planned to introduce exotic breeds while those of Mulo-Sululta planned to introduce high grade
         cows into their farms. Furthermore, all the farmers at all the study areas regardless of the options they preferred, emphasized
         the necessity of availability of feed, specially concentrates for their plan to succeed. A chi-square statistics result showed
         that there was a significant variation between the study areas concerning options preferred to attain a shorter age at first
         calving (p&lt;0.001). However, there were no significant variation between the affiliation groups and farm scales (p&gt;0.05).

         interval. 
      </p>
						<p>Most of the "SDDP follow farmers" (77.6%) believed that the calving interval could be improved through improved feeding while
         only 54.8% of the "SDDP contact farmers" believed so. The remaining proportion of farmers in both cases preferred the use
         of high grade cows to improve calving interval.

   The existing pattern of mating practices</head>
						<p>There was a significant difference between the three study areas in the existing pattern of mating practices (p&lt;0.001). Most of the farmers both at Mulo-Sululta (90) and Degem (85%) were using only natural mating while the remaining proportion
         of farmers at Mulo-Sululta and Degem used both AI and natural service alternatively (Figure 5. 12). There was also a significant
         difference (p&lt;0.05) between the "SDDP contact farmers" and "SDDP follow farmers" at Selale area in that 77.4% of the "SDDP
         contact farmers" and 93.9% of the "SDDP follow farmers" used natural mating while 22.6% of the "SDDP contact farmers" and
         6.1% of the "SDDP follow farmers" used both natural mating and AI. 
      </p>
						<p>In Addis Ababa, 75% of the farmers used only AI and 17.5% of the farmers used only natural mating while the remaining proportion
         of farmers (7.5%) used both AI and natural mating alternatively (Figure 5.12). Differences in the existing pattern of mating
         practices were not significant between the farm scales in Addis Ababa.

						</p>
						<p>Regarding the reason for the type of mating practice used, a chi-square result indicated that there was a significant difference
         (p&lt;0.05) between the different study areas. More than half of the farmers at Mulo-Sululta (62.5%) and in Addis Ababa (66.7%),
         and three fourth (74.5%) of the farmers at Degem used natural mating because it was easily accessible. On the other hand,
         a significant proportion of farmers at Mulo-Sululta (32.5%) and some farmers in Addis Ababa (13.3%) and at Degem (7.5%) used
         natural mating because of familiarity. There was also a significant variation (p&lt;0.05) between the two affiliation groups
         at Selale in that 6.5% of the "SDDP contact farmers" and 29.2% of the "SDDP follow farmers" used natural mating due to their
         familiarity to the service. However, there was no significant difference between the different farm scales in Addis Ababa
         regarding reasons for the use of mating practices (p&gt;0.05). 
      </p>
						<p>
         			The most important reasons mentioned, for using AI in Addis Ababa include the belief that AI provides semen from bulls specifically selected for milk production
         (43.3%), accessibility of AI (23.3%), familiarity with AI (16.7%), and lack of alternatives (13.2%). The remaining 3.3% of
         the farmers believed that AI is cheaper than natural mating.

   Times of service and season of mating</head>
						<p>The results of chi-square statistics showed that time of service for heats detected in the morning was affected significantly
         by the study areas (p&lt;0.001). 95% of the farmers at Mulo-Sululta, 74.4% of the farmers at Degem and 42.9% of farmers in Addis
         Ababa take 
         
								<pagenumber edition="95"/>
							their cows for natural mating during the same morning heat is detected while all the other farmers do it in the afternoon.
         
      </p>
						<p>When heat signs were detected in the afternoon, 95% of the farmers at Mulo-Sululta, 43.6% of the farmers at Degem and 14.3%
         of the farmers in Addis Ababa take their cows in the same afternoon for natural mating and all other farmers in the next morning.
         The variation between the study areas was significant (p&lt;0.001). 
      </p>
						<p>With regard to times of service using AI in Addis Ababa, 23.3% of the farmers could get AI service in the same morning of
         heat detection while 73.3% of them could get AI service in the afternoon. If cows were detected in heat during the afternoon,
         20% of the farmers could get the service the same afternoon while 80% would get AI service the next morning. There was no
         variation between farm scales (p&gt;0.05).
      </p>
						<p>Some farmers from Degem (25.6%) and Addis Ababa (35%), mentioned seasonal preferences to mate their dairy cattle while farmers
         at Mulo-Sululta had no preference (p&lt;0.05). There was also a significant (p&lt;0.01) variation only between the study areas with
         regard to the season preferred and the reasons for season preference (p&lt;0.05). All the farmers at Degem preferred the long
         rainy season while in Addis Ababa most of the farmers (75%) preferred the beginning of the dry season and some (25%) preferred
         the short rainy season. The farmers at Degem and some farmers in Addis Ababa (21.4%) mentioned availability of feed as reason
         while most of the farmers in Addis Ababa (71.4%) wanted to avoid an overlapping of the peak milk yield period with the fasting
         season of the Ethiopian Orthodox Christians (between February and April) during which people do not eat animal products.

   Mating management and record keeping</head>
						<p>The result of chi-square statistics indicated that there was a significant variation (p&lt;0.01) between the different study
         areas regarding the proportion of farmers having knowledge about bulls serving their cows. All the farmers at Degem and most
         of the farmers (82.5) at Mulo-Sululta and in Addis Ababa (70%) had knowledge about the performance of the bull serving their
         cow. The variations between the two affiliation groups at Selale and the three farm scales in Addis Ababa were not significant.
         However, all farmers using AI had 
         
								<pagenumber edition="96"/>
							limited knowledge about the AI bulls used except the belief that AI provides semen from bulls specifically selected for milk
         production.
      </p>
						<p>Concerning mating confirmation, the result of chi-square test showed that there were significant variations between the study
         areas (p&lt;0.001) and the two affiliation groups at Selale (p&lt;0.01). 92.3% of the farmers at Degem and 70% of the farmers in
         Addis Ababa using natural mating confirm the mating. However, at Mulo-Sululta only half of the farmers (50%) were doing the
         same. 93.5% of the "SDDP contact farmers" and 56.3% of the "SDDP follow farmers" were confirming mating. There was no significant
         variation between the different farm scales in Addis Ababa regarding confirmation of mating (p&gt;0.05).
      </p>
						<p>In addition, there were significant variations between the study areas (p&lt;0.001) and the two affiliation groups at Selale
         (p&lt;0.001) regarding the proportion of farmers keeping records. Most of the farmers at Degem (75%) and in Addis Ababa (87.5%)
         and less than half of the farmers at Mulo-Sululta (45%), had mating records. Most of the "SDDP contact farmers" (93.5%) had
         mating records while a significant portion of "SDDP follow farmers" (39.6%) did not have mating records. All the farmers that
         used natural mating kept only records of time of service, mostly based on recalling, while those farmers that used AI in Addis
         Ababa wrote records including times of heat on-set and times of service. There was no significant variation between the three
         farm scales in Addis Ababa (p&gt;0.05).

         Ababa said they had not so far encountered any problem with getting natural service. All the farmers that said they had a
         problem with the natural mating relate it to the poor libido of the bulls. In Addis Ababa, nearly half of the farmers using
         AI (46.7%) said they had problem with AI. More than 93% of these farmers said the AI service was not reliable in that the
         inseminators were not punctual. The chi-square statistics result regarding problems associated with breeding methods used
         indicated that there was no significant difference between the study areas, the two affiliation groups at Selale and the three
         farm scales in Addis Ababa (p&gt;0.05).

							All the farmers at Mulo-Sululta, 89.7% of the farmers at Degem and 90% of the farmers in Addis Ababa using bull service, without
         any significant variation between the study areas, the two affiliation groups at Selale, and the three farm scales in Addis
         Ababa (p&gt;0.05), were satisfied with the bull service they were getting. However, half of the farmers in Addis Ababa using only AI (50%) said they were not satisfied with the AI service and thus 33.3% of all the
         farmers looked for the alternative of using natural mating.

   Bull ownership</head>
						<p>All the the bull owners at Degem kept bulls as a source of income. However, bull owners at Mulo-Sululta had diversified objectives
         of bull keeping. 42.9% of them kept bulls as a source of income while the same percentage of farmers kept bulls both for mating
         purpose within their own farm and also for draught purposes. The remaining bull owners at Mulo-Sululta (14.3%) kept bulls
         only for in-farm mating uses. Differences between the study areas and the affiliation groups at Selale were significant (p&lt;0.001).
      </p>
						<p>In addition, there was no significant (p&gt;0.05) variation between the study areas regarding the breed composition of bulls
         in the areas. 72.7% of the bulls belonging to the "SDDP contact farmers" were pure Friesian while 18.2% were 50% Friesian crosses and a few were indigenous. 22.1 % of the "SDDP follow farmers" used pure
         Friesian and 77.8% used 75% Friesian crossbred bulls. "SDDP follow farmers" obtained bulls from individuals owning dairy cows
         in the village and the surrounding areas and the average price for a bull was birr 623.3. On the other hand the "SDDP contact
         farmers" were provided with pure Friesian bulls by the SDDP for birr 300 that would be refunded to the farmers after 50 calves
         are born through the bull's service.

						<p>83.3% of the farmers at Mulo-Sululta and all of the farmers at Degem kept their bulls in a separate barn, while the remaining
         bull owners kept their bulls in corrals mixed with other cattle. A bull was on average supplied with 3.15 kg of crop residue,
         0.75 kg of wheat bran, 1 kg of oilseed meal and 4.05 kg of hay per day. Bulls on average were allowed to graze for 5.05 hours.

						<p>The average length of duration of service was 25 months for bulls owned by "SDDP contact farmers" and 18 months for "SDDP
         follow" farmers. The "SDDP contact farmers" and "follow farmers" were planning to continue to use the bulls for an average
         of 40 months and 30 months, respectively. 50% of the farmers at Mulo-Suluta and 64.3% of the farmers at Degem had plans to
         replace their bulls. More than half of the "SDDP contact farmers" (54.5%) and the "SDDP follow farmers" (66.7%) didn&#8217;t have
         the plan to continue keeping a bull considering the business of keeping bulls unprofitable. A chi-square test showed that there was no significant variation between the study areas and the two affiliation groups concerning
         the plan to replace bulls (p&gt;0.05). 
      </p>
						<p>60 % of the bull owners at Mulo-Sululta, that were interested in keeping bull in the future, were planning to replace the
         bulls by a male offspring from their own herd while 40% indicated to replace their bulls by purchasing from another farm.
         In the case of Degem, 66.7% of the farmers were planning to replace their bulls through government sources while the remaining 33.3% were planning to buy replacement bulls from other farms.
         More than half of the "SDDP contact farmers" (60%), with a plan to continue bull keeping, were planning to replace their bulls
         from male progeny in their own farm while the remaining farmers were planning to buy replacement bulls from government sources
         (20%) and other farms (20%). On the other hand, 37.5% of the "SDDP follow farmers" depended on buying from government sources
         while 37.5% and 25% depended on other farms and own farm offspring, respectively, to replace bulls. The variations between
         the study areas and the affiliation groups were not significant (p&gt;0.05).

   Bull management</head>
							<p>
         			Bull housing and feeding:
         			 the breeding bulls of the Centre have been housed in a well constructed barn. The pure Friesian bulls and other crossbred
         bulls, that are big in size, are kept separately (1 bull/pen) while local bulls or replacement bulls have been kept at two
         per pen. The bulls are allowed to leave their pens and have some exercise for one hour every day and their hooves are examined
         for necessary trimming. Each bull in the Centre is supplied with hay (adlibitum), 3 kgs of a balanced concentrate and 25 gm
         mineral lick per day. 
         		
      </p>
							<p>
         			Bull selection: 
         			The Centre imports bulls from abroad that are progeny tested and gets also information about the milk productivity of the
         bulls' dam. Selection criteria are high daily 
         			
         
									<pagenumber edition="102"/>
								
         			milk yield, lactation length and fat content of milk. In addition, the Centre has been also checking for functional efficiency
         factors like libido, temperament, body condition and morphological soundness of the bulls. 
         		
      </p>
							<p>
         			Age at first service: 
         			the most important characteristic the Centre uses to determine the readiness of bulls for service is the age of bulls coupled
         with evaluation of semen quality. The Centre is performing semen evaluation for bulls starting from 18 months of age. 
         		
      </p>
							<p>
         			Record keeping: 
         			even if it was not complete over the time, the Centre has been keeping records of semen evaluation analyses for each bull. The Centre has also kept monthly records of number of first, second, third and fourth
         services, number of pregnancies and number of progenies per inseminators. Even though the Centre has the mandate to record
         milk performance of AI progenies as part of the National Dairy Recording Scheme, there were no valuable information collected
         at the time of this study.
         		
      </p>
							<p>
         			Bull fertility tests and culling: 
         			The Centre had no defined time table to test the fertility of breeding bulls. Casual fertility tests are performed based on
         reports on the field efficiency of the AI. The fertility test included palpation of the testicles for abnormalities, measuring
         scrotal circumference and rectal examination of the accessory glands and semen evaluation. The Centre has been culling bulls
         that failed the fertility tests
         			 
         			and sell the bulls for slaughter. 
         		
      </p>
							<p>
         			Disease control: 
         			the Centre has been performing Brucellosis test on each bull every six months and no bull was positively tested so far.

   Semen production</head>
							<p>Semen production in the Centre had no consistent trend through the years from 1995 to 1999 (Figure 5.13). 2.77%, 7.08%, 3.57%,
         4.45% and 12.80% of the semen straws produced were discarded in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. 30.9%, 14.8%,
         12% and 9.5% of the discarded semen straws were so due to poor motility, presence of blood in the semen, high dead-alive cell ratio and
         poor concentration, respectively. 
      </p>
							<p>
								
									<pagenumber edition="103"/>
								
								<mm entity="Object19">
									<caption>Figure 5.14. Number of semen straws produced, semen straws discarded and loss in birr in the National Artificial Insemination Centre</caption>
								</mm>
							</p>
							<p>A relatively high percentage of the straws (28.7%) were also discarded due to technical failures during semen production.
         The remaining percentage (4.2%) was accounted for poor motility after thawing.
      </p>
							<p>The Centre calculated an average production cost of 14 birr (1.75 EUR) per dose. The Centre has been charging 5 birr per conception in and around
         Addis Ababa and 2 birr per conception in the rural areas. When this cost is multiplied with the average national value for
         the number of services per conception (2.4), the Centre has incurred a cost of birr 40.8 (5 EUR) per conception. Thus, the Centre has been subjected to a loss of birr 35.8 or 38.8 per conception in and
         around Addis Ababa and in rural areas, respectively. Furthermore, the high number of discarded straws does also amount to a large monetary loss.

   Semen quality</head>
							<p>The Centre has been performing semen quality evaluation tests for semen collected at the AI station taking into consideration
         semen volume, spermatozoa concentration per ml of semen, mass motility, individual motility and thaw motility. However, the
         information that has been recorded so far lack consistency over time. Table 5.41 contains the average values of semen volume,
         spermatozoa concentration per ml of semen, mass motility and thaw motility for the years from 1995 to1999. There was a trend
         of increasing spermatozoa concentration through the years and the same trend was seen for semen volume except for 
         
									<pagenumber edition="104"/>
								the year 1999 that has a semen volume value less than that of 1998. There was no clear trend for the other parameters through
         the years.

						<p>The least squares means for factors affecting semen quality (Table 5.44) revealed that there is a trend of increased semen
         volume through the years with the exception of 1999. The spermatozoa concentration is also higher for the recent years. The
         other two parameters show variable trends through the years. Except for the post-thaw motility all other parameters of semen
         quality were better in the wet season than the dry season but only the effect on spermatozoa concentration was significant
         (P&lt;0.05). 
      </p>
						<p>The highest value for semen volume was found for 75% Friesian crosses with Arsi and the lowest was that of Fogera. The highest
         concentration was that of 50% Friesian crosses with Arsi and the lowest concentration was found for Friesian bulls. Jersey
         bulls had the best motility while 75% Friesian crosses with Arsi had the least motility value. Friesian bulls had the highest
         value for thaw motility and Fogera had the lowest thaw motility.

         			Venereal disease awareness, incidences of abortion and prevalence of Brucellosis
      </head>
				<p>All the cows and bulls included in this study in all the study areas tested negatively for Brucellosis using the Rose Bengal
         Plate Test. The results of this study also showed that most of the farmers at Selale, 82.5% at Mulo-Sululta and 90% at Degem
         were not aware of any disease that is transmissible through mating. In addition, all the bull owners at Mulo-Sululta and Degem
         had no any idea about venereal diseases. More "SDDP contact farmers" (22.6%) were aware of venereal diseases than "SDDP follow
         farmers" (8.2%). In Addis Ababa, more than half of the farmers (60%) were aware of venereal diseases. Most of the large scale
         (71.4%) and medium scale (71.4%) dairy farms and slightly more than half of the small scale farmers (53.8%) knew of venereal
         diseases. 
      </p>
				<p>Only 2.5% of the farms at Selale, all of which were farms of "SDDP contact farmers", reported incidences of abortion. In addition,
         none of the bull owners at Selale area encountered cases of abortion within the dairy cows herd that got service from their
         bulls. In Addis Ababa, there were incidences of abortion in 37.5% of the farms. The highest incidences in Addis Ababa were
         in large scale farms (85.7%) followed by medium scale (42.9%) and small scale farms (23.1%). Most of the abortions occurred
         in farms that used both AI and bull service in Addis Ababa (66.7%) and the abortion incidence in farms that used bull service
         (36.7%) was higher than those that used AI (28.6%). 80% of the abortions in Addis Ababa and all the abortions at Selale area
         took place before the third trimester of pregnancy. The remaining 20% of the abortions in Addis Ababa took place during the
         third trimester of pregnancy. All farmers, with incidences of abortion in their farms, diagnosed abortion by seeing the aborted
         foetus. Most of the small scale farmers (80.8%) and more than half of the medium scale farmers (51.7%) did not know which
         bull served their cows immediately before the incidence of abortion whereas 71.4% of the large scale farms with incidences of abortion knew the bulls
         that served their cows. All the medium and large scale farmers and 80% of the small scale farmers with incidences of abortion
         kept the cows with histories of abortion in their farms till the time this study was carried out. The remaining proportion
         of cows with incidences of abortion in the small scale farms were sold to other farms. All the farms with incidences of abortion,
         irrespective of the farm scale, were using the same bull or semen from AI bulls for breeding after abortion. Only 7.7% of
         the small scale farms experienced abortion again.

   Farming system characteristics</head>
				<subsection>
					<head>
      
   Farming system characteristics at Selale</head>
					<p>The mean values for family size at Selale area (7.54 persons) were closer to those reported by Abdinasir (2000) (7.9 persons
         per household at Arsi area) and considerably higher than those reported by Niftalem (2000) (5.6 persons and 4.6 persons at
         Inewari and Debre Berhan, respectively). Another result of this study indicated that cattle herd size was significantly and
         positively affected by family size. Similar findings were reported by Abdinasir (2000). It seems that households with larger
         family size are encouraged to own more livestock since they have a large family labor resource. The mean labor force required
         per household at Selale was estimated to be 5.5 persons (MOA and FINNIDA, 1996). Furthermore, the findings of this study indicated
         that most of the responsibilities for dairy cattle management were that of the husbands and wives were participating in all
         the activities and were primarily responsible for herding of dairy cattle. This shows that the responsibilities pertaining
         dairy cattle management requires the attention of family members with a higher status since crossbred dairy cattle are considered
         as high value assets. However, othe reports that took into consideration the whole livestock herd indicated that activities
         like milking and barn cleaning were restricted to women, feed preparation and feeding were the responsibilities of men and
         herding was taken care of by children (MOA/FINNIDA, 1996, Getachew et al., 1993). 
      </p>
					<p>
         			The cattle herd compositions found in both 
         			woredas
         			 of Selale were dominated by cows (38.7-44.7%) most of which were crossbred (62-74%). This finding is partly in agreement
         with what has been reported by Gashaw et al. (1991) for Selale where cows comprised 51.8% of the cattle herd, 62% of which
         were indigenous. The high proportion of cows in the cattle herd and the increasing proportion of crossbred cows indicate the importance
         of dairying at Seale area. 
         		
      </p>
					<p>Oxen (steers), that are mainly kept in the household for ploughing (Panin and Brokken 1993), also comprised a significant
         proportion of the cattle herd at Selale area (31.4%) which is in agreement with the reports of Abdinasir (2000) and Getachew et al. (1993) who indicated that a considerable proportion of the cattle herd was also composed
         of oxen 
         
							<pagenumber edition="110"/>
						at Arsi area (43.23%) and Inewari (38%), respectively. The high proportion of oxen in the cattle herd is the reflection of
         the importance of cropping in the areas. Shapiro et al. (2000) reported that in the central highlands of Ethiopia, the income
         from crop sales comprises about 31% of the total farm income in households that keep crossbred dairy cows.
      </p>
					<p>
         			The results of this study showed also that crop yield per hectare at Selale had significant and positive associations with
         the number of crossbred cows in a farm, the amount of concentrate supplementation and the estimated daily milk yield. Estimated
         daily milk yield increased with the increment of concentrate supplementation and the level of exotic blood. It is assumed
         that this increases income to the household due to increased milk sales which in turn improves liquidity that could be used
         to intensify inputs to crop production. Shapiro et al. (2000) reported that about 44% of the farm income in households keeping
         crossbred dairy cattle in the central highlands of Ethiopia was from dairy sales. The finding in this study that estimated
         daily milk yield is significantly and positively affected by genotype of cows and feeding is in agreement with previous reports.
         According to Kiwuwa et al. (1983) indigenous breeds had a significantly lower lactation milk yield than 50% crosses of Friesian
         and Arsi. In addition, Abdinasir (2000) has also reported that the up-grading level of cows significantly affected milk yield,
         with high grade cows producing more milk than the low grade cows. 
         			
         			Tawah et al. 
         			(1995), at the Assela station in the Arsi region of Ethiopia, revealed that lactation performance of pure breed Arsi and crosses
         of Friesian and Arsi breeds was significantly and positively affected by postpartum supplementation with concentrate mixes.
         Improved milk yield after supplementation with concentrates was reported also by Little et al. 
         			(1987), Kurtu (1992) and Khalili et al. 
         			(1991).

   Farming system characteristics in Addis Ababa</head>
					<p>The family size of dairy farm households in Addis Ababa (5.58 persons) is comparable with that reported by Demeke and Wolde-Gabriel
         (1985) who reported an average family size of 5.4 persons. In contrast to Selale area, most of the management activities in
         the medium and large scale farms were run by sons of the household and this could be probably due to the fact that 60.5% of
         the dairy cattle owners in this study had a side line occupation and could not fully handle the responsibility of dairy cattle
         management. On the other hand, the dairy management could also be a good professional option for sons of the households in
         considering the fact that alternative job opportunities are scarce. In 
         
							<pagenumber edition="111"/>
						addition, hired labor was also being used in the large scale and medium scale farms since the owners can afford labor wages.
         In the small-scale farms, the involvement of the husband and the wife was considerable and comparable to that of the Selale
         area.
      </p>
					<p>The proportion of cows with 75% or more exotic blood increased with farm size and households without sideline occupation (specializing
         in dairy) kept significantly larger herd size and larger number of crossbred cows with 75% or more exotic blood than those
         with sideline occupations. This shows that most of the large scale farmers were specializing in dairy. In addition, wheat
         bran supplementation was significantly and positively affected by farm size. Another result of this study revealed that daily
         milk yield increased with the increment of farm size, exotic blood level and concentrate supplementation (oilseed meal and
         wheat bran). These all indicate that specialized dairy farmers in Addis Ababa have access to external feed resources which
         allow the use of cows with high exotic blood levels. In turn, specialized urban dairy afrmers attain the highest milk yield
         of all systems included in this study.
      </p>
					<p>The findings regarding effects of genotypes of cows and concentrates on estimated daily milk yield are in agreement with results
         of works of Kiwuwa et al (1983), Kurtu (1992), Little et al. (1987) and Khalili et al. (1991).

   Breeding practices</head>
				<subsection>
					<head>
      
   National dairy cattle breed improvement activities</head>
					<p>Ethiopia has no active breeding policy and breeding program that provides the frame and standards for breeding activities
         in the country. A breeding policy prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture and submitted to the government in 1985 was never
         put to action till to date. In addition, the Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization has recently prepared working documents
         on livestock breeding policies and is awaiting further refinement through a workshop and approval from the government. The
         report of a study project involving a group of students of the Department of Tropical and Subtropical Animal Breeding of the
         Humboldt University of Berlin (2000) substantiates this fact, and highlights that there were no breeding associations or co-operatives
         of breeders, no identification and performance recording policy, no program for distributing bull services and no breeding
         program indicating breeding objectives and subsequent activities. 
         
							<pagenumber edition="112"/>
						However, there were a number of attempts at different times by the government in collaboration with donors and non-governmental
         organizations to improve the productivity of dairy cattle in the country. These attempts include the Dairy Cattle Crossbreeding
         Program at IAR (Institute of Agricultural Research), the Chilalo Agricultural Development project, the Establishment of the
         National AI Center, Establishment of Dairy Cattle Improvement Ranches, the Selale Peasant Dairy Development Pilot Project
         and the Small-holder Dairy Development Projects. These attempts had played their own role in developing the dairy sector in
         the country. However, according to EARO (2001) a number of reasons have been hampering dairy cattle breed improvement activities.
         Some of the projects lacked a well defined breeding program and have not taken into account the existing production systems,
         animal health situations and feed resources. The productivity of improved breeds of cattle were thus constrained by erratic
         and inadequate rainfall that cause a low fodder yield potential, the need for concentrates which are not available at affordable
         prices and a wide variety of fatal diseases. In addition, the relatively better performing projects lacked sustainability.
         Zarate (1996) indicated that a long term breeding strategy can be pursued only if conditions are favorable as animal breeding
         requires stability and continuity. 
      </p>

   Breeding practices by individual farmers</head>
					<p>The results of this study showed that high daily milk yield was the most important preferred performance trait by individual
         farmers, irrespective of the study areas, affiliations and farm scales. It was also placed as the first priority performance
         trait by both the dairy cow owners and the bull owners. This indicates the importance of milk as a source of income in market
         oriented dairy production system in the urban, per-urban and rural highland areas. The impact of the SPDDPP and SDDP achieved
         through the introduction and distribution of crossbred dairy cattle and improved feed, and the improvement in the milk marketing
         and processing infrastructure are the main determinants for farmers to consider milk yield as the most important trait at
         Selale. In addition. expanded market opportunities in Addis Ababa and other regional towns and cities, act as a stimulant
         for development of dairy production and increased use of crossbred cows. 
      </p>
					<p>
						
							<pagenumber edition="113"/>
						High fat content was also considered as a preferred performance trait by a significant proportion of farmers at Mulo-Sululta
         that is located closer to Addis Ababa but where the DDE milk collection centers are less developed than at Degem. Thus, the
         lack of a market infrastructure for liquid milk changes the emphasis on butter production to optimize the utilization of milk
         produced in the region. Debrah (1990) reported that those rural dairy farms located within 20 km distance from Addis Ababa
         and far from the milk collection centers sold less fresh milk and more butter and cheese. Previously, Gryseels and de Boudt
         (1986) indicated the importance of high fat content and recommended crossbreeding with breeds that produce milk with higher
         butter fat content in areas with poor road and market accesses where milk needs to be processed to cheese and butter.
      </p>
					<p>
         			Age at first calving was also one of the preferred performance trait mentioned by farmers in all the study areas. This could
         be explained by the overall mean values of age at first calving in this study that are in general high (39.4 months at Selale
         and 30 months in Addis Ababa). Furthermore, the average value of age at first calving at Selale was higher than that of Addis
         Ababa. The fact that the dairy herd in Addis Ababa is dominated by up-graded cows could be the reason for the differences.
         This is supported by the finding in this study that age at first calving decreased with the increment of exotic blood level
         across the different study areas. This finding is in agreement with the report of Negussie et al (1998) who indicated a significant effect of breed of cow on age at first calving, with F
         			1
         			 cross heifers (from local cows and Jersey and Friesian sires) calving significantly earlier than indigenous heifers. 
         			Kiwuwa et al. 
         			(1983) also reported that the 75% exotic crosses with Arsi calved significantly earlier than all other breed groups.

					<p>The results of this study showed that farmers mainly depended on indirect information about performances of individual dairy
         cows inorder to decide on which cow to acquire. This indicates that farmers tend to relay on indirect information about cow's
         own performance in situations where there are no performance recording activities. The accuracy of indirect information not
         based on official recording of performances is difficult to access and farmers, thus, are exposed to high trabsaction costs
         whenever cows are purchased. At Degem, many farmers were also using the information about the dam and progeny of cows to acquire
         cows. This is mainly because, SPDDPP and SDDP had been doing development work at Degem for about two decades and thus there
         is a limited activity of performance recording by farmers. Almost all bull owners depended on the 
         
							<pagenumber edition="114"/>
						performance information they get about the dam of the bulls. Payne and Wilson (1999) stated that progeny performance is a
         particularly valuable source of information to select bulls. However, Syrstad and Ruane (1998) indicated that the long time
         required to see progeny performance is one of the drawbacks of progeny testing and selection based on pedigree information
         resulted in faster rate of genetic improvement. In addition, the long generation intervals and difficulties in establishing
         and running a field milk-recording system are also indicated by Chacko (1994) as problems related to performance identification based on progeny.

         			The findings of this study showed that the introduction of crossbred cows with higher exotic blood was considered as an option
         by nearly half of the farmers at Selale area and slightly more than half of the farmers in Addis Ababa to improve the milk
         production. Another study conducted at Selale area some years before also indicated that the interviewed farmers were in favor
         of exotic cows and the authors predicted that their number probably would increase in the future (Gashaw et al., 1991). 
         			Azage et al. 
         			(2000) stated that crossbred and grade animals were preferred by 44% of the intra-urban dairy farmers in Addis Ababa. On the
         other hand, a significant portion of the farmers in this study at all the study areas were not in favor of the idea of introducing high
         grade dairy cows and most of the farmers in all the study areas did not have the plan to introduce purebred exotic cows, rather
         they stressed the importance of improving their feeding regime. This could be due to the uncertainty of farmers regarding
         their capability to manage cows with higher exotic blood levels. The importance of considering the available resource and
         ecological production conditions in planing a breed improvement program was indicated by Peters (1991). In addition, he elaborated
         that any increase in production intensity in association with breed improvement programs changes cost-benefit ratios and increases
         production risk and, thus, requires the ability of farmers to sustain this changes. Furthermore, Syrstad (1985) testified
         that upgrading of exotic blood over 50% does not increase milk yield. In another work, Syrstad (1998) indicated that even
         if crossbreeding has in most cases led to a dramatic increases in productivity in the first crossbred generation (F
         			1
         			), but further upgrading by repeated back crossing to exotic bulls has often resulted in problems which can be ascribed to
         lack of adaptation. In addition, Sjoberg (1985) reported that to produce the same amount of milk the high graded cows require
         more concentrate feed than others.

							<pagenumber edition="115"/>
						In Addis Ababa, there was a significant difference between the farm scales concerning their preferred option to improve the
         productivity of their dairy cattle. Most of the large scale farmers were satisfied with the performance potential of their
         dairy herd while the majority of the small scale and medium scale farmers had the intention of introducing crossbred cows
         with higher exotic blood. This is related to the genotype composition of the dairy herd in Addis Ababa in that most of the
         high grade cows are owned by large scale farms while a significant proportion of the dairy herds of small scale and medium
         scale farms were composed of crossbred cows with 50% or less exotic blood. 
      </p>
					<p>Concerning options preferred by farmers to improve age at first calving and calving interval, almost of all the farmers at
         Mulo-Sululta believed that both traits could be improved through improved feeding regime. Their preference is proved by the
         reports of Dennis and Thiongane (1978) who indicated that Gobra (Senegal Fulani) heifers kept on pasture and fed balanced concentrate supplement calved at an earlier age (30 months) than unsupplemented heifers.
         At Degem and in Addis Ababa, a considerable proportion of the farmers had the opinion that both traits could be improved by raising
         the level of exotic blood in their herd. However, the work of Syrstad (1985) indicated that upgrading has negative effects
         on age at first calving and calving interval. Another result of this study showed that calving interval significantly decreased
         with increased level of education and was lowest in farms owned by civil servants in Addis Ababa, which may be related to
         the effect of improved management. The increased awareness of better educated farmers and civil servants through formal education
         and affiliations to agricultural fields for improved postpartum management and heat detection could have contributed considerably
         to improve management efficiency.

   General considerations</head>
					<p>About 99% of the total cattle population (about 99%) in Ethiopia is composed of indigenous cattle (AFRDMD and MOA, 1991).
         There are over six main cattle types in Ethiopia which have a regional distribution and have evolved under the impact factors
         like climate, altitude, available feed supply, endemic diseases, preferred function and management circumstances (Albero and
         Solomon (1982) and Ethiopian Mapping Agency, (1981)). These indigenous cattle are handled by smallholder farmers and are kept
         mainly 
         
							<pagenumber edition="116"/>
						as part of the mixed crop-livestock production systems and the pastoral production systems (MOA, 1993). Mating is often random
         and there is no strict selection of mating pairs (Bittner et al., 2000). The remaining small proportion of cattle population
         in Ethiopia is composed of improved genotypes (purebred exotic or crossbred cattle) and kept by large scale state and private
         owned dairy farms, intra-urban and peri-urban small-holder dairy farms and market-oriented rural-small-holder mixed crop-livestock
         farms in the central highlands. Crossbreeding of indigenous cows with exotic bulls either through natural mating or AI, is
         practiced to attain an improved production level. However, to date there is no breeding policy and formal organization and
         coordination of the bull service or the AI service at either national or regional level in a way to optimize crossbreeding
         and mating services. In order to acquire crossbred cows farmers have to organize their own access to breeding bulls, unless
         they are part of projects like the SDDP which provide and organize breeding services.
      </p>
					<p>
         			Most of the farmers at Selale were using natural mating with crossbred bulls kept by individual farmers while most of the
         farmers in and around Addis Ababa were using AI. The farmers at Selale were getting the bull service without any major problem
         and had no difficulty in bringing a cow in heat to a bull service farm. The results also indicated that a significant proportion
         of SDDP follow farmers were not familiar with the AI service. These results showed that natural service is the best practical
         option for farmers at Selale. Similar findings were reported by Abdinasir (2000) who found AI being used by the majority of
         the farmers (87.5%) at Bilalo located relatively closer to Asela, where there is a well developed infrastructure for AI services,
         whereas it was only used by a very small proportion of the farmers at Lemmu (8.3%) located relatively far from Asela. These all indicate
         that AI seemed to be constrained by a number of factors to extend services to the rural areas while it has been effective
         in Addis Ababa even if there was still the problem of punctuality in delivering the service. A number of reasons like organizational
         problems associated with the administration of the AI service, lack of logistical support related to production and distribution
         of semen and liquid nitrogen supply, lack of well trained and experienced AI technicians, communication problems between AI
         technicians stationed usually in 
         			Woreda
         			 towns and farmers living far from main roads, and communication technologies all contribute to the poor effectiveness of
         the AI service at Selale area. 
         			
         			Azage et al. 
         			(1995) and a summary of a recent FAO electronic conference (2000) on the appropriateness, significance and application of
         individual biotechnologies in developing 
         			
         
							<pagenumber edition="117"/>
						
         			countries indicated that poor heat detection skills of farmers, poor semen quality, inappropriate semen handling procedures,
         wrong timing of insemination and inefficiency of inseminators, insufficient means of communication and infrastructure, difficulty
         to bear costs for the production of liquid nitrogen and purchase of necessary equipment and poor management of AI operations
         are some of the problems associate with AI.

   Bull service organization at village level</head>
					<p>
         			SDDP had been the most important source of breeding bulls at Seale area. The project provided purebred Friesian bulls, to
         individual farmers for birr 300 which had to be given back to the farmers after 50 calves had been born through the bull's
         service (SDDP/OAB, 1999). The results of this study showed that 36 farms or 42 cows are attended per bull in the course of
         a year. Even though the average number of farms attended per bull was below what had been intended by the SDDP (78 farms per bull), the average
         number of cows attended per bull was close to previous bull-cow ratio recommendations. Barrett and Larkin (1974) recommended
         a bull-cow ratio of 1:50-60 for hand mating where mating is done at owners discretion. 
         			Lee et al. 
         			(1998) recommended a bull-cow ratio of 1: 40-50. 
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			On average, the "SDDP contact farmers" and the "SDDP follow farmers" planned to use their breeding bulls for a total period
         of four to five years and more than half of the bull owners did not have the plan to replace their bulls. The lack of confidence
         by farmers at Selale to acquire a replacement bull indicates some serious organizational problems in liking rural farmers
         with sources of good breeding stock; a task previously performed by SDDP, that phased out at the time of this study. 
         			Lee et al. 
         			(1998) and IIRR (2000) recommended to use a bull from 2 to 4 years in a herd and replace or switch it thereafter. By taking
         a bull-cow ratio of 1:42, which is working well at Selale area, it is possible to project that about 880 breeding bulls are
         required per year to serve about 37000 crossbred cows found within the central highlands of the country. If the bulls are
         used for four years and with a risk allowance of 10 % due to diseases, fertility problems and mortality, a total of 242 replacement
         bulls need to be available annually.
         		
      </p>
					<p>The bull service at Selale provided efficient service to users and resulted in a high non-return rate, pregnancy rate and
         calving rate. High efficiency rates due to bull service was also reported by previous works. Wattiaux (1998) stated that many
         farmers believe that pregnancy rates are higher when a bull is used, even in areas where artificial insemination 
         
							<pagenumber edition="118"/>
						has proven to be very effective. In addition, Naidoo et al (1981) reported in Mauritius that natural mating was more effective
         than AI with 91% of calving intervals being less than 14 months compared with only 49 % from AI. The work of Hailemariam et
         al. (1983) also indicated that calving interval of Boran cows served by Boran bulls were shorter than those of cows served
         by AI. 
      </p>
					<p>No cow or breeding bull was tested positive for Brucellosis in this study and the farm incidence of abortion was very low
         and these encourage the use of bull services in the rural areas. Very low prevalence rates of Brucellosis were reported in
         the rural areas by Tekleye et al. (1989), Abebe (1989) and Bayleyegn (1989). However, farmers at Selale in general were not
         aware of venereal diseases and this indicates a lack of extension work to increase farmers awareness on venereal diseases,
         especially with the introduction of crossbred cows and bull services in the area.

   AI service organization and delivery</head>
					<p>The irregular trend of semen production in the National Artificial Insemination Center over the years from 1995 to 1999 could
         indicate inconsistency in the activities of the Center. Either the Center had no clear objectives and production plans or
         there were irregularities in the allocation of funds and other inputs to the Center, making it difficult for the Center to
         fulfil its objectives. The Center also had to discarded significant portions of the semen produced. It was not clear why the
         Center was processing semen with poor mass or individual motility and concentration, with a high dead-alive ratio and with
         blood contamination. It would have been better if semen with either of the above mentioned problems was discarded at the time
         of collection before any additional processing and storage cost had been incurred. In addition, the cost-price ratio for semen
         straws showed that the AI service is highly subsidized. However, farmers in the rural areas were not beneficiaries of this
         subsidy since the service is not readily available while urban and peri-urban farmers, that are in a better financial status
         and could pay more, are benefiting most from this subsidy.

         			The average values of semen volume (6.82-9.35 ml), spermatozoa concentration (1.14-1.39 X 10
         			9
         			/ ml), mass motility (68.2-75.5%) and thaw motility (44-51%) found in this study are not much different from reports of previous
         works. The National AI Center previously produced semen of Friesian bulls with a volume of 6.7 to 9.6 ml while spermatozoa
         
         			
         
							<pagenumber edition="119"/>
						
         			concentration ranges in value from 1.1 to 1.4 X 10
         			9
         			/ ml and mass motility and thaw motility varied from 76.5-79% and 51.4-51.2% respectively (Azage et al., 1995). The semen
         quality values of this study are greater than those reported by Stolla and Trombach (1999) in Germany. They reported that
         in 1996 the mean semen volume for AI bull stations using Simmental, Holstein-Friesian and Brown Swiss breeds ranges from 4.05
         ml to 5.2 ml and spermatozoa concentration of the bulls ranged from 0.944 X 10
         			9
         			 to 1.245 X 10
         			9
         			. 
         			
         			
         				
         			
         		
      </p>
					<p>
         			The semen quality at the National AI Center was significantly affected by year of production, season of the year and breed
         of bulls. There was a tendency of an increased semen volume and decreased thaw motility in recent years. The other traits
         varied irregularly over the years. Regarding seasonal differences, all the semen traits except thaw motility were higher in
         the wet season. In addition, 75 % Friesian-Arsi crosses had the best volume, 50% Friesian-Arsi crosses had the highest concentration,
         Jersey bulls had the best motility and Friesian bulls had the best thaw motility. The variation of semen quality traits through
         time is also reported by van Os et al. (1997) and Foote (1978). The work of Mathelon et al. (1998) indicated that season significantly
         affected all semen traits in young bulls but did not significantly affect semen volume and spermatozoa concentration in mature
         bulls. They reported that semen traits were better in winter than in summer. 
         			In addition, Kumi-Diaka et al. 
         			(1981) reported that higher sperm abnormalities, lower percentage of live spermatozoa and lower sperm concentrations were
         observed in Bos taurus bulls in the tropics during hot periods. However, this difference was not observed in Bos indicus bulls.
         
         			Azage et al. 
         			(1995) indicated that season alters endocrine profiles and hence influences fertility. He further elaborated that hyperthermia
         reduces testosterone levels and impairs the maintenance of normal spermatogenesis. A significant breed effect on semen traits
         was reported by Chenoweth et al. (1996) with temperate Bos taurus (Angus and Hereford) breeds being generally superior to
         Bos indicus breeds (Brahman, Nellore X Brahman) in sperm motility and percentages of normal spermatozoa. On the other hand,
         Tegene et al. (1992) reported that there was no significant variation between young pubertal Boran and crossbred Boran-Friesian bulls
         in semen traits. The better performance of the crossbreeds in this study with respect to semen traits could be due to their
         ability to withstand environmental stresses better than the purebred exotic bulls.

						The AI application in Addis Ababa varied from 8756 to 9138 cases per year between 1997/98 and 1999/00. According to the information
         released from the Center (2000) the average annual AI applications per year for the years from 1984 to 2000 were 20649. This
         indicates that 42.2% to 44.3% of the AI activity took place in Addis Ababa. The average annual AI application by the National
         Artificial Insemination Center in the country was lower than the average value that has been reported by Chupin and Schuh
         (1992) for African countries. Their report indicated that the average AI applications per year per country in Africa is 30637
         which is far below the values for Asian, Latin America and Near East countries. 
      </p>
					<p>
         			The
         			 
         			
         				average values of non-return rates (60-90 days) for the National AI Center were higher than those reported by Rocha et al.
         (2001) for one of the largest dairy cooperatives in Portugal (71.7%) and by Leichniak et al. (1998) for dairy bulls in Poland
         (60%, 60 days). Mukassa-Mugrewa et al (1991) reported that pregnancy rates to AI do not exceed 45% in Africa. The exceptionally
         high non-return rate value in the National AI Center of Ethiopia could arise from the poor quality of post AI service recording.
         Another reason could also be that AI might have been compounded with subsequent natural service. Many farmers use bull services
         in times of AI failure, without reporting this to inseminators. The fact that the non-return rate was significantly affected
         only by the inseminators in this study could also indicate the possibility that AI failure could be linked to the skills of
         inseminators. This finding is in agreement with what has been reported by Rocha et al. (2001) and Vandoormaal (1993). Wittiaux
         (1998) indicated that improper insemination technique is one of the problems associated with low efficiency of AI.
         		
      </p>
					<p>The regular test practice for Brucellosis on the bulls owned by the National Artificial Insemination Center and the absence
         of positively tested bulls is encouraging. The result of this study showed that there was no positively tested dairy cow for
         Brucellosis in Addis Ababa where most of the farmers are using AI. However, this finding is not in agreement with that of
         Yilkal (1998). He reported a total prevalence rate of 8.1% (using the Rose Bengal Plate Test and Complement Fixation Test)
         for crossbred cows in intra- and peri-urban dairy production systems in and around Addis Ababa. There are reports indicating
         that Brucellosis is rarely transmitted through mating (Sprott and Field, 1998). However, if semen from infected bull is used
         for AI, there is a considerable risk of inseminated cows being infected. The most important risk factors for the transmission
         of Brucellosis are poor 
         
							<pagenumber edition="121"/>
						hygienic conditions like exposure to aborted foetus, placentas or new born calves from infected cows (Thumond and Hietala,
         2000) and hence it is more important in larger herds than smaller herds. This fact was witnessed by Yilkal (1998) in that
         the prevalence of Brucellosis was significantly higher in herds that kept more than 100 cattle (9.1%) than those that kept
         less than or equal to 50 cattle (3.3%). The absence of positive reactors for Brucellosis test in this study could be due to
         the small herd size of most of the farms in Addis Ababa included in the sampling. Only seven farms with a herd size of more
         than 10 cows were included in this study. In addition, the recent work of Yilkal (1998) in Addis Ababa could have contributed
         a lot in increasing the awareness of farmers in and around Addis Ababa and measures could have been taken by farmers to eliminate
         positive cows. This is evidenced by another finding of this study that showed most farmers were aware of the risk of venereal
         diseases in Addis Ababa. The value on awareness in this study is much higher than the report of Yilkal (1998) who found that
         87.8% of the farms in and around Addis Ababa were not aware of venereal diseases. However, the proportion of farms which experienced
         abortion in Addis Ababa was high and is not much different from that reported by Yilkal (1998). He reported that 56.1% of
         the farms experienced abortions in and around Addis Ababa. In addition, this study showed that the proportion of farms which
         experienced abortion was increasing with the increment of farm size in Addis Ababa. This situation was also observed by Tekleye
         et al (1989) in the Central Ethiopia. In their work, the highest incidence rate of abortion was found in the largest farm.
         Increase in herd size could expose cows to more physical stress, insufficient observation and management, competition for
         available feed resource and infections. This study showed also that the highest propotion of farms which experienced abortion
         were farmers that used both bull service and AI service. One of the reasons for the high incidence rate of abortion in farms
         using both AI and bull service could be repeated services without proper pregnancy diagnosis. Dailey (1992) indicated that
         insemination of pregnant cows leads to abortions.

         			Conclusions and recommendations
      </head>
			<p>At Selale and in small scale farms in Addis Ababa, family members are the most important sources of labor. In addition, responsibilities
         of dairy cattle management were undertaken mostly by members of the family at high status, husband and wife. Dairying is also an important source of income to the household in both areas. These indicate that dairying is becoming an important
         component of the farming activities at Selale and a means of livelihood and a part-time business for most of the smallholders
         in Addis Ababa. 
         		
      </p>
			<p>Crop yield per hectare was positively associated with the number of crossbred dairy cows, the daily milk output and concentrate
         input, and this is a reflection of intensification of crop production enabled by market oriented dairy in the rural area.
         It is important, therefore, to improve market linkages to the rural areas.
      </p>
			<p>In Addis Ababa, inputs in terms of genotypes of dairy cows and feed, and milk output were higher in specialized dairy farms
         than in farms owned by part-time farmers. 
      </p>
			<p>A future dairy development plan in the urban area needs to give appropriate attention to this distinction between the types
         of farmers in the urban and peri-urban dairy production systems.
      </p>
			<p>In the absence of formal performance information farmers relay on informal individual cow performance observation for purchase
         of cows and selection of replacements. This indicates that t
      </p>
			<p>here is a need for a community based action to develop alternative reliable performance assessment and documentation options.</p>
			<p>The preferred performance traits in the different study areas reflected their relative economic value in their respective
         localities. Milk yield performance was preferred in all locations while high fat content was also considered in locations
         with low market linkage. 
      </p>
			<p>Therefore, economically based breeding objectives need to be defined in the context of the existing production conditions
         and market relations in the areas.
      </p>
			<p>
				
					<pagenumber edition="123"/>
				Natural mating is the essential mating practice in rural areas with easily accessibility and a satisfactory efficiency as a result of SDDP intervention. However, the continuity of the bull service is at stake due to
         the absence of an efficient bull replacement scheme. 
      </p>
			<p>This indicates the importance for defining a breeding program to secure the ability for selecting replacement bulls in a sustainable

			<p>AI is most prominent in urban and peri-urban dairy production systems but with variable reliability in terms of timely service.
         
      </p>
			<p>To make AI more reliable delivery modes need to be improved. In addition, the AI service highly subsidizes the urban and per-urban
         farmers (the actual AI users) which are capable of paying more. It is thus essential to undertake cost-price analyses to come
         up with a reasonable price.
      </p>
			<p>The fact that no cow and bull was found positive for Brucellosis in all the study areas indicates that currently there is
         no risk in using bull service. However, it is important to undertake regular tests for Brucellosis on breeding bulls (natural
         and AI) to monitor future risks of infection.

         			Summary
      </head>
			<p>This study was carried out at Selale area and in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The main objectives were to understand the conditions
         of dairy production systems and identify the existing breeding practices and organizational patterns and efficiency of bull
         services and artificial insemination with some hygienic considerations. 
      </p>
			<p>A sample of 80 households (31 "SDDP contact farmers" and 49 "SDDP follow farmers") that owned 236 dairy cows and 20 households
         (10 "SDDP contact farmers" and 10 "SDDP follow farmers") that own 20 breeding bulls were selected randomly from the Selale
         area (Mulo-Sululta and Degem) and a sample of 40 dairy farms (26 small scale, 7 medium scale and 7 large scale) that owned
         491 dairy cows were selected randomly from Addis Ababa. A detail questionnaire was prepared and data were collected based
         on one visit interview that was supported with observation. In addition, personal communication with the National Artificial
         Insemination Center personnel and data collected by the Center for five years (1995-1999) were being used as sources of data.
         All the dairy cows and breeding bulls included in this study were also tested for Brucellosis using the Rose Bengal Plate
         Test. Data collected from the dairy cow and bull owners include farming system and socioeconomic characteristics, dairy cattle
         feeding, estimated performance of dairy cattle, sources of information for acquisition of dairy cows and breeding bulls, preferred
         performance traits by farmers, options set by farmers to improve dairy performance, bull service organization and efficiency,
         AI service organization and efficiency and awareness of farmers on venereal diseases prevalence and control methods. The data
         were analyzed using the SPSS computer software (SPSS for windows, release 10.05, 1999). Bar graphs were prepared using the
         Microsoft Excel (2000) program while line graphs were prepared using the Statistica computer software (Statistica for widows,
         Kernel release 5.5 A, 1999).
      </p>
			<p>The overall mean for family size in all the study areas was 6.9 persons. The highest mean value for family size was found
         at Degem with 8.10 persons and the lowest mean value for family size was found in Addis Ababa with 5.58 persons. There was
         no much difference between Mulo-Sululta (9.73 TLU) and Degem (9.20 TLU) in livestock holding. In both areas, the livestock
         herd was dominated by cattle (54.8%) and sheep (32.7%). With regard to cattle herd size and composition, cows contribute the
         highest proportion in all the study 
         
					<pagenumber edition="125"/>
				areas. Cows comprised 38.3% and 44.7% of the cattle herd at Mulo-Sululta and Degem, respectively. In Addis Ababa, more than
         half of the cattle herd was composed of cows. 
      </p>
			<p>Most of the DM supplied originated from natural pasture hay (43.7%) and crop residues (40.4%) at Selale area and 62% and 38%
         of the DM originated from natural pasture hay and concentrates, respectively, in Addis Ababa. Dairy cows at Selale area and
         in Addis Ababa were supplied with metabolizable energy that meets nearly all the maintenance and production requirement (considering
         the average daily milk yield in this study) and crude protein that exceeds the requirements. 
         		
      </p>
			<p>At Mulo-Sululta and Degem and in small scale farms in Addis Ababa most of the responsibilities in dairy cattle management
         was that of the husband and wife. In all of the large scale and medium scale farms and 60% of the small scale farms in Addis
         Ababa feeding of the dairy cattle was done by laborers. Milking of the dairy cows and most of the management practices like
         breeding, health monitoring and housing were covered by sons of the farmers in medium and large scale dairy farms. 
      </p>
			<p>
         			Cattle herd size was affected positively and significantly by
         			 
         			family size and grazing land size. Crop yield per hectare affected significantly the number of crossbred dairy cows and there
         was a tendency of increment in the number of crossbred dairy cows with the increment of crop yield per hectare.
         		
      </p>
			<p>In Addis Ababa, only type of side line occupation affected cattle herd size, number of cows and number of 75% crossbred cows
         in a herd. Households that specialize in dairy (without sideline occupation) had the largest herd size, number of cows and
         number of all levels of crossbred cows. Civil servants had the smallest herd size value. 
      </p>
			<p>In the analyses of factors affecting feeding regime, "SDDP contact farmers" supplemented significantly higher amount of concentrate
         than "SDDP follow farmers". In addition, supplementation with concentrates significantly increased with increment of crop
         yield per hectare. In Addis Ababa, supplementation with wheat bran significantly increased with the increment of the farm
         size.
      </p>
			<p>At Selale, dairy cows owned by "SDDP contact farmers" produced significantly higher estimated daily milk yield at the middle
         of lactation and were milked for shorter period of time than those owned by "SDDP follow farmers". In addition, estimated
         daily milk yield 
         
					<pagenumber edition="126"/>
				increased significantly with the increment of crop yield per hectare at the beginning and middle of lactation. Estimated daily
         milk yield increased also with the increment of percentage of exotic blood and supplementation with concentrates and crop
         residues at all stages of lactation. 
      </p>
			<p>In Addis Ababa, estimated daily milk yield increased significantly at all stages of lactation with farm size and with the
         increment of exotic blood and supplementation with oilseed meal. There was also a significant increment in estimated daily
         milk yield at the middle and end of lactation with the increment of wheat bran supplementation. In addition, dairy cows owned
         by farmers with out sideline occupation gave significantly higher estimated daily milk yield at the beginning of lactation
         while those dairy cows owned by civil servants gave significantly higher daily milk yield in the middle and at the end of
         lactation. As to the lactation length, farmers with out sideline occupation milked their cows for a significantly longer time
         than the others while civil servants milked their cows for a shorter time than the others. 
      </p>
			<p>Analyses of factors affecting the estimated reproductive performance of dairy cows at Selale area indicated that age at first calving decreased significantly as the percentage of exotic blood increased. In Addis Ababa, age at first calving
         increased significantly with the increment of farm size while calving interval decreased significantly with the increment
         of level of education. Dairy cows owned by civil servants had the shortest calving interval. Furthermore, number of services
         per-conception increased significantly with the increment of oilseed meal supplementation.
      </p>
			<p>The most important preferred performance trait by dairy cow owners in all the study areas and the bull owners at Selale area
         was high daily milk yield that was considered as the first priority selection criteria in all the study areas by most of the
         farmers. There was a significant difference between the study areas with regard to second priority preferred performance trait,
         in that a considerable proportion of the farmers mentioned high fat (39.5%) and longer lactation length (31.6%) at Mulo-Sululta,
         shorter age at first calving (54.5%) at Degem and longer lactation length (40%) in Addis Ababa. In addition, about half of the bull owners at Mulo-Sululta and Degem put high fat content as the second priority
         preferred performance trait . 
      </p>
			<p>
				
					<pagenumber edition="127"/>
				With regard to sources of information for acquisition of dairy cows, most of the farmers at Mulo-Sululta (95%), Degem (82.5%)
         and Addis Ababa (75%) individual performance information. In the case of bulls, 84.7% of the bull owners at Mulo-Sululta and
         all the bull owners at Degem used dam performance.
      </p>
			<p>52.5-65% of the farmers in all the study areas planned to attain higher milk yield through the introduction of cross breeds
         with higher exotic blood into their herd. In Addis Ababa, most of the large scale farms (85.7%) were satisfied with productivity
         of their dairy herd while most of the small scale (76.9%) and medium scale (85.7%) farms had the plan to introduce dairy cows
         with higher exotic blood. Almost all the farmers at Mulo-Sululta believed that age at first calving and calving interval could
         be improved only with better nutrition. However, most of the farmers at Degem (77.8%) and in Addis Ababa (85.7%) planned to
         improve age at first calving of their dairy cattle herd through the introduction of high grade cows into their farms. With
         regard to calving interval, 42.5% and 57.5% of the farmers at Degem and in Addis Ababa respectively believed that calving interval could be improved through
         improved nutrition. 
      </p>
			<p>Most of the farmers both at Mulo-Sululta (90%) and Degem (85%) were using only natural mating. In Addis Ababa, 75% of the
         farmers used only AI. The variations between the study areas were significant. Most of the farmers at Selale area (80%) used
         village bulls while 40% of the farmers in Addis Ababa, most of which are large scale farms, had their own bulls. 84.6%-92.5%
         of the farmers at Selale area and all the farmers using bull service in Addis Ababa could get the service in less than 30
         minutes of walking distance. Almost all the farmers at Selale area and in Addis Ababa using bull service were satisfied with
         the bull service while half of the farmers using AI in Addis Ababa were satisfied with AI. Lack of punctuality was mentioned
         by most of the AI users in Addis Ababa, that had problem with AI, as the most frequent problem. 
      </p>
			<p>The "SDDP contact farmers" were provided with bulls from the project for 300 birr (refundable after 50 calves are born) while
         the "SDDP follow farmers" bought bulls from individuals in the area (average price 623.3 birr). The bulls were used on average
         for 18-25 months and 50-64.5 % of the bull owners had plan to replace the bulls after 30-40 months. On average 36 farms and
         42 cows were getting bull service per bull at Selale area and a bull could service on average 3.0 cows per day. The price
         per conception of bull service 
         
					<pagenumber edition="128"/>
				ranges from 3 to 5 birr. The non-return rate (60-90 days), pregnancy rate and calving rate were 85.62- 97.31%, 95.10% and
         94.67%, respectively. 
      </p>
			<p>
         			The National Artificial Insemination Center owned 50 breeding bulls out of which 14 were used for semen collection and others
         were replacement bulls. 64.1% of the bulls used for semen collection were Friesian. The others were Barka (14.3%) and crosses
         between Arsi and Friesian (21.4%). The annual semen production in the Center for the years 1995-1999 ranges from 23,580 to
         103,440 straws. From 2.77% to 12.8% of the semen straws were discarded per year due to a number of reasons. The Center expended
         14 birr (1.75 EUR) per semen straw and charged 5 birr per conception in the urban areas and 2 birr per conception in the rural
         areas. The average values for semen volume, spermatozoa concentration, motility and thaw motility for the years 1995-1999
         ranged from 6.82-9.35 ml, 1.14-1.39x10
         			9
         			, 68.2-75.5% and 44-51%, respectively. The non-return rate (60-90 days) in using AI ranged from 78-80%. Semen quality was
         significantly affected by year of production and breed of bulls while Non-return rate was affected significantly with the
         efficiency of inseminators. 
         		
      </p>
			<p>82.5-95% of the farmers at Selale area were not aware of any disease that is transmissible though mating. In Addis Ababa,
         more than half of the farmers (60%) were aware of venereal diseases. The farm abortion incidence rate was 2.5% at Selale area
         and 37.5% in Addis Ababa. The highest incidences in Addis Ababa were in large scale farms (85.7%) followed by the medium (42.9%)
         and small scale farms (23.1%). With respect of prevalence of Brucellosis, all the cows and bulls tested negatively using the
         Rose-Bengal Plate Test.

         			Zusammenfassung
      </head>
			<p>Die Untersuchung wurde im Gebiet Selale und in Addis Abeba, &Auml;ethiopien, durchgef&uuml;hrt. Die Hauptziele der Arbeit waren die
         Analyse der Bedingungen von Milchvieh-Produktionssystemen, Zucht- und Anpaarungspraktiken und der Organisation des Bullenservice
         sowie der k&uuml;nstlichen Besamung inkl. einiger hygienischer Betrachtungen.
      </p>
			<p>Eine Stichprobe von 80 Haushalten (31 SDDP-Kontakt-Betriebe und 49 SDDP-Folge-Betriebe) mit 236 K&uuml;hen und 20 Haushalten (10
         SDDP-Kontakt-Betriebe und 10 SDDP-Folge-Betriebe) mit 20 Zuchtbullen wurde zuf&auml;llig aus dem Selale Gebiet (Mulo-Sululta und
         Degem) ausgew&auml;hlt sowie eine Stichprobe von 40 Milchviehbetrieben (26 Kleinbetriebe, 7 mittelgro&szlig;e Betriebe und 7 Gro&szlig;betriebe)
         mit 491 K&uuml;hen aus Addis Abeba. Die im Landwirtschaftsministerium des Woreda Distrikts vorliegenden Haushaltslisten wurden
         als Grundlage f&uuml;r die Zufallsstichprobe verwendet. Ein detaillierter Fragebogen wurde vorbereitet, und die Daten wurden auf
         der Basis eines Interviews und entsprechenden Beobachtungen w&auml;hrend eines einmaligen Betriebsbesuchs erhoben. Au&szlig;erdem wurden
         pers&ouml;nliche Mitteilungen sowie Besamungsdaten von 5 Jahren (1995-1999) des National Artificial Insemination Center als Datenquellen
         verwendet. S&auml;mtliche in dieser Arbeit ber&uuml;cksichtigten Milchk&uuml;he und Zuchtbullen wurden auf Brucellose mit dem Rose-Bengal-Ringtest
         untersucht. Die von den Milchkuh- und Bullenbesitzern erhobenen Daten umfassen Betriebssystem, sozio-&ouml;konomische Charakteristika,
         Milchkuhf&uuml;tterung, Produktivit&auml;t der Milchk&uuml;he, Informationsquellen f&uuml;r Leistungsidentifikation, von den Bauern aufgestellte
         bevorzugtes Leistungsmerkmal, von den Bauern aufgestellte Optionen zur Verbesserung der Produktivit&auml;t der Milchk&uuml;he, Organisation
         und Effizienz des Bullenservice, Organisation und Effizienz des Besamungsservice sowie Bewusstsein der Bauern &uuml;ber die Pr&auml;valenz
         von Geschlechtskrankheiten und Behandlungsmethoden. Die Daten wurden mit dem Softwareprogramm SPSS (SPSS f&uuml;r Windows vom 10.05.1999)
         analysiert. Balkendiagramme wurden mit Microsoft Excel (2000) erstellt, Liniendiagramme mit Statistica (Statistica 5.5 A,
         1999).
      </p>
			<p>Der Gesamtmittelwert f&uuml;r die Familiengr&ouml;&szlig;e in allen Untersuchungsgebieten lag bei 6,9 Personen. Der h&ouml;chste Mittelwert f&uuml;r
         Familiengr&ouml;&szlig;e wurde in Degem mit 8,10 Personen gefunden, der niedrigste Mittelwert in Addis Abeba mit 5,58 Personen. Bei den
         
         
					<pagenumber edition="130"/>
				Viehbest&auml;nden gab es kaum einen Unterschied zwischen Mulo-Sululta (9,73 TLU) und Degem (9,20 TLU). In beiden Gebieten bestand
         die Viehherde zum gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Teil aus Rindern (54,8%) und Schafen (32,7%). Was die Rinderherde betrifft, so nahmen die K&uuml;he den
         gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Anteil in allen Untersuchungsgebieten ein. K&uuml;he umfassten 27,2% der Rinderherde in Mulo-Sululta und 35% in Degem.
         In Addis Abeba bestand die Rinderherde zu &uuml;ber der H&auml;lfte aus K&uuml;hen. 
      </p>
			<p>Der gr&ouml;&szlig;te Teil der verabreichten Trockenmasse stammte im Gebiet Selale von Heu (43,7%) und Ernter&uuml;ckst&auml;nden (40,4%), in Addis
         Abeba von Heu (62%) und Kraftfutter (38%). Die Milchk&uuml;he im Gebiet Selale und in Addis Abeba wurden mit umsetzbarer Energie
         versorgt, die nahezu den gesamten Haltungs- und Produktionsbedarf (durchschnittliche t&auml;gliche Milchmenge in dieser Arbeit)
         deckten, und mit Rohprotein &uuml;ber den Bedarf hinaus. 
      </p>
			<p>In Mulo-Suluta, Degem und in den kleinen Milchviehbetrieben in Addis Ababa war der Ehemann und die Ehefrau f&uuml;r den gr&ouml;&szlig;ten
         Teil der Aktivit&auml;ten in der Rinderhaltung verantwortlich. In den gro&szlig;en und mittleren Betrieben sowie in 60% der Kleinbetriebe
         in Addis Abeba wurden Lohnarbeiter zur F&uuml;tterung der Milchk&uuml;he eingesetzt. Das Melken der K&uuml;he und die meisten Haltungspraktiken
         wie Anpaarung, &Uuml;berpr&uuml;fung des Gesundheitszustandes und Stallung wurde in den gro&szlig;en und mittleren Betrieben von den S&ouml;hnen
         der Bauern &uuml;bernommen. 
      </p>
			<p>Die Rinderherdengr&ouml;&szlig;e wurde positiv und signifikant von der Familiengr&ouml;&szlig;e und Weidefl&auml;che beeinflusst. Der Ernteertrag pro
         Hektar hatte einen signifkanten Einfluss auf die Anzahl der Kreuzungsk&uuml;he mit der Tendenz einer Zunahme der Kreuzungsk&uuml;he
         bei zunehmendem Ernteertrag pro Hektar. 
      </p>
			<p>In Addis Abeba hatte ausschlie&szlig;lich die Art des Nebenerwerbs einen Effekt auf die Herdengr&ouml;&szlig;e, die Anzahl K&uuml;he und die Anzahl
         der 75%-Kreuzungsk&uuml;he in einer Herde. Haushalte ohne Nebenerwerbst&auml;tigkeit hatten die gr&ouml;&szlig;ten Herden, die h&ouml;chste Anzahl an
         K&uuml;hen und Kreuzungsk&uuml;hen aller Kreuzungsstufen. Verwaltungsbeamte hatten die kleinsten Herden. 
      </p>
			<p>In den Analysen der Faktoren des F&uuml;tterungsregimes, SDDP-Kontakt-Bauern f&uuml;tterten mehr Kraftfutter als SDDP-Folge-Bauern.
         Zudem stieg die Zuf&uuml;tterung mit Kraftfutter mit 
         
					<pagenumber edition="131"/>
				zunehmendem Ernteertrag pro Hektar. In Addis Abeba wurde nur die Zuf&uuml;tterung mit Weizenkleie signifikant von der Betriebsgr&ouml;&szlig;e
         beeinflusst, wobei die Zuf&uuml;tterung mit Weizenkleie mit zunehmender Betriebsgr&ouml;&szlig;e stieg. 
      </p>
			<p>Die Analyse der Faktoren der t&auml;glichen Milchmenge und der Laktationsdauer im Gebiet Selale zeigten an, dass die Milchmenge
         von K&uuml;hen der SDDP-Kontakt-Bauern in der Laktationsmitte signifikant h&ouml;her war als die von K&uuml;hen der SDDP-Folge-Bauern und
         &uuml;ber einen deutlich k&uuml;rzeren Zeitraum gemolken wurden. Die t&auml;gliche Milchmenge wurde auch noch vom Ernteertrag am Beginn und
         in der Mitte der Laktation signifikant beeinflusst. Auch nahm die t&auml;gliche Milchmenge mit zunehmendem exotischen Genanteil
         und der Zuf&uuml;tterung mit Kraftfutter und Ernter&uuml;ckst&auml;nden in allen Laktationsstadien zu. 
      </p>
			<p>In Addis Abeba nahm die t&auml;gliche Milchmenge in allen Laktationsstadien signifikant mit der Betriebsgr&ouml;&szlig;e und mit zunehmendem
         exotischen Genanteil und der Zuf&uuml;tterung mit &Ouml;lsaatenmehl zu. Ebenso konnte eine signifikante Erh&ouml;hung in der Milchmenge in
         der Mitte und am Ende der Laktation mit zunehmender Verf&uuml;tterung von Weizenkleie beobachtet werden. Au&szlig;erdem gaben die K&uuml;he
         von Bauern ohne Nebenerwerbst&auml;tigkeit zu Beginn der Laktation deutlich mehr Milch, w&auml;hrend die K&uuml;he von Verwaltungsbeamten
         in der Mitte und am Ende der Laktation deutlich mehr Milch gaben. Was die Laktationsl&auml;nge betrifft, so wurden die K&uuml;he von
         Bauern ohne Nebenerwerb deutlich l&auml;nger gemolken als alle anderen, w&auml;hrend die K&uuml;he von Verwaltungsbeamten &uuml;ber den k&uuml;rzesten
         Zeitraum hinweg gemolken wurden.
      </p>
			<p>Die Analyse der Faktoren der Reproduktionsleistung der Milchk&uuml;he im Gebiet Selale zeigte, dass das Erstkalbealter signifikant
         mit dem exotischen Genanteil sank. In Addis Ababa nahm das Erstkalbealter signifikant mit der Betriebsgr&ouml;&szlig;e zu. Die Zwischenkalbezeit
         nahm mit zunehmendem Bildungsniveau der Bauern ab. Die K&uuml;he von Verwaltungsbeamten h&auml;ufiger kalbten als die von Haushalten
         mit kleinen bzw. ohne Nebenerwerbst&auml;tigkeiten. Weiterhin nahm die Zahl der Bedeckungen bzw. Besamungen mit zunehmender Zuf&uuml;tterung
         mit &Ouml;lsaatenmehl zu.
      </p>
			<p>Was die Informationsquellen zur Leistungsidentifikation betrifft, so nutzten die meisten Bauern in Mulo-Sululta (95%), Degem
         (82,5%) und Addis Abeba (75%) die Eigenleistung der K&uuml;he. Bei den Bullen verwendeten 84,7% der Bullenbesitzer in Mulo-Sululta
         und 
         
					<pagenumber edition="132"/>
				s&auml;mtliche Bullenbesitzer in Degem die Mutterleistung als Informationsquelle zur Leistungsidentifikation.
      </p>
			<p>Das f&uuml;r die Milchkuhbesitzern wichtigste Lesitungsmerkmal war eine hohe Milchmange, und zwar in allen Untersuchungsgebieten.
         Dies wurde von dem meisten Bauern in allen Untersuchungsgebieten bevorzugtes Leistungsmerkmal erster Priorit&auml;t betrachtet.
         
      </p>
			<p>Es gab einen signifikanten Unterschied zwischen den Untersuchungsgebieten hinsichtlich der bevorzugten Leistungsmerkmale zweiter
         Priorit&auml;t: ein betr&auml;chtlicher Teil der Bauern erw&auml;hnte einen hohen Fettgehalt (39,5%) und eine l&auml;ngere Laktationsdauer (31,6%)
         in Mulo-Sululta, ein niedrigeres Erstkalbealter (54,5%) in Degem und eine l&auml;ngere Laktationsdauer (40%) in Addis Abeba. Au&szlig;erdem
         nannten ungef&auml;hr die H&auml;lfte der Bullenbesitzer in Mulo-Sululta und Degem einen hohen Fettgehalt als bevorzugtes Leistungsmerkmale zweiter Priorit&auml;t.
      </p>
			<p>52,5-65% der Bauern in allen Untersuchungsgebieten hatten die Absicht, einen h&ouml;heren Milchertrag durch die Haltung von Kreuzungsk&uuml;hen
         mit einem h&ouml;heren exotischen Genanteil zu erlangen. In Addis Abeba waren die meisten Gro&szlig;betriebe (85,7%) mit der Produktivit&auml;t
         ihrer Milchkuhherde zufrieden, die meisten kleinen (76,9%) und mittelgro&szlig;en Betriebe (85,7%) hingegen hatten die Absicht,
         Kreuzungsk&uuml;he mit einem h&ouml;heren exotischen Genanteil einzustallen (p&lt;0,01). Jedoch hatten die meisten Bauern in Degem (77,8%)
         und in Addis Abeba (85,7%) vor, das Erstkalbealter ihrer Milchkuhherde durch die Einf&uuml;hrung von K&uuml;hen mit einem hohen exotischen
         Genanteil zu verbessern. Was die Zwischenkalbezeit betrifft, so glaubten 42,5% der Bauern in Degem und 57,5% der Bauern in
         Addis Abeba, dass diese durch eine verbesserte Ern&auml;hrung verbessert werden k&ouml;nnte.
      </p>
			<p>Es gab einen signifikanten Unterschied (p&lt;0,001) zwischen den Untersuchungsgebieten hinsichtlich der Pr&auml;ferenz von Methoden,
         die selektierten Gene zu verbreiten. Die meisten Bauern in Mulo-Suluta (90%) und in Degem (85%) machten nur vom Natursprung
         Gebrauch. In Addis Abeba, nutzten 75% der Bauen ausschlie&szlig;lich die k&uuml;nstliche Besamung. Die meisten Bauern im Gebiet Selale
         (80%) nutzten die Dorfbullen, w&auml;hrend 40% der Bauern in Addis Abeba, die meisten davon Gro&szlig;betriebe, ihren eigenen Bullen
         hielten. F&uuml;r 84,6%-92,5% der Bauern im Gebiet Selale und alle Bauern in Addis Abeba, die den Natursprung nutzten, waren der
         Deckbulle in weniger als 30 Minuten Fu&szlig;weg zu

				erreichen. Nahezu alle Bauern im Gebiet Selale und in Addis Abeba, die den Natursprung nutzten, waren mit dem Deckservice
         zufrieden, w&auml;hrend die H&auml;lfte der Bauern in Addis Abeba, die die k&uuml;nstliche Besamung nutzten, mit derselben zufrieden waren.
         Unp&uuml;nktlichkeit wurde von den meisten Nutzern der k&uuml;nstlichen Besamung in Addis Abeba, die Probleme damit hatten, als h&auml;ufigstes
         Problem genannt.
      </p>
			<p>Die SDDP-Kontakt-Bauern erhielten ihre Bullen vom Projekt gegen eine Bezahlung von 300 Birr (R&uuml;ckerstattung nach 50 geborenen
         K&auml;lbern) w&auml;hrend die SDDP-Folge-Bauern ihre Bullen von Privatpersonen in der Gegend kauften (Durchschnittspreis 623,3 Birr).
         Die Bullen wurden bis dahin im Durchschnitt 18-25 Monate genutzt, und 50-64,5% der Bullenbesitzer hatten vor, die Bullen nach
         30-40 Monaten zu ersetzen.
      </p>
			<p>Im Durchschnitt nahmen 36 Betriebe und 42 K&uuml;he im Gebiet Selale den Deckservice je Bulle in Anspruch, und ein Bulle konnte
         im Durchschnitt jeweils 3,0 K&uuml;he an einem Termin decken. Der Preis je Konzeption lag zwischen 3 und 5 Birr. Die Non-Return-Rate
         (60-90 Tage), die Tr&auml;chtigkeitsrate und die Kalberate lagen bei jeweils 85.62- 97.31%, 95.10% und 94.67%,
      </p>
			<p>
         			Das National Artificial Insemination Center besa&szlig; 50 Zuchtbullen, von denen 14 zur Samenproduktion eingesetzt wurden, die
         anderen waren Ersatzbullen. 64,1% der Besamungsbullen waren Friesen, die anderen geh&ouml;rten zur Rasse Barka (14,3%) bzw. Waren
         Kreuzungen zwischen Arsi und Friesen (21,4%). Die j&auml;hrliche Samenproduktion des Center in den Jahren 1995-1999 lag zwischen
         23&nbsp;580 und 103&nbsp;440 Samenportionen. 2,77% bis 12,8% der Samenportionen wurden j&auml;hrlich aus verschiedenen Gr&uuml;nden verworfen.
         Das Center gab 14 Birr (1,75 EUR) je Samenportion aus und verlangte 5 Birr je Konzeption in den st&auml;dtischen Gebieten und 2
         Birr je Konzeption auf dem Land. Die Durchschnittswerte f&uuml;r Spermavolumen, Spermiendichte, Motilit&auml;t und Motilit&auml;t nach dem
         Auftauen in den Jahren 1995-1999 lag jeweils zwischen 6,82-9.35 ml, 1.14-1.39x10
         			9
         			, 68.2-75.5% und 44-51%. Die Non-Return-Rate (60-90 Tage) nach der k&uuml;nstlichen Besamung lag zwischen 78% und 80%. Die Samenqualit&auml;t
         wurde signifikant von Produktionsjahr und genetischer Gruppe der Bullen beeinflusst. Die Non-Return-Rate wurde signifikant
         vom Geschick der Besamungstechniker beeinflusst.
         		
      </p>
			<p>82,5-95% der Bauern im Gebiet Selale waren sich keiner Krankheit bewusst, die sich durch den Deckakt &uuml;bertragen l&auml;sst. In
         Addis Abeba waren sich mehr als die H&auml;lfte der 
         
					<pagenumber edition="134"/>
				Bauern (60%) &uuml;ber Geschlechtskrankheiten im Klaren. Die Abortrate lag bei 2,5% im Gebiet Selale und bei 37,5% in Addis Abeba.
         Die meisten Aborte in Addis Abeba traten in den Gro&szlig;betrieben auf (85,7%), gefolgt von den mittel gro&szlig;en (42,9%) und den Kleinbetrieben
         (23,1%). 80% der Aborte in Addis Abeba und alle Aborte im Gebiet Selale fanden vor dem letzten Drittel der Tr&auml;chtigkeitsperiode
         statt. Was die Auftreten von Burcellose betrifft, so war das Ergebnis mit dem Rose-Bengal-Ringtest bei s&auml;mtlichen untersuchten
         K&uuml;hen und Bullen negativ.
