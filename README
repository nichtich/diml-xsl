README for DiML-styles version 0.1c

These are XSL Stylesheets for the DiML XML DTD
(or to be honest they are planned to be).

The DiML DTD is a modularized XML schema for scientific
documents developed at the Humboldt University, Berlin.
For more information on DiML, see http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/diml/

Changes
-------

We just started using CVS

Installation
------------

1. Choose a directory 
2. Unpack the distribution in a subdirectory (for instance 'diml-xsl')
2. Get the DiML-DTD and unpack it in another subdirectory called 'dtd'
3. Open the file
     diml-xsl/examples/test.xml
   in Mozilla, Internet Explorer or another Browser with an XSLT engine.
   If you get no error message but a HTML view, everything works fine.
   If you get an error message like "can not find '../../dtd/xdiml.dtd'"
   then you have to change the path of the DiML-DTD.


Use
---

Use your favorite XSLT processor to process DiML documents with
the stylesheet diml2html.xsl.

You can directly view the output in a XSLT-capable browser if you put

  <?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="diml-xsl/diml2html.xsl"?>

in your DiML-Document (change path to where you put the DiML-styles).
  
Some configuration settings may be set to german language by default.
